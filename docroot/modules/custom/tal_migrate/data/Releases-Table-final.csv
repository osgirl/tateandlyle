71,auto,Legacy Import,2/1/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle set to end citric acid production at Selby__*__ Yorkshire.,"Tate & Lyle has started a consultation process with employees today with a view to ceasing production of citric acid in Selby__*__ Yorkshire. The announcement follows intense competition from Chinese imports and oversupply in the world market. Closure would affect approximately 100 jobs at the Selby site. The consultation process will last 90 days.

Stanley Musesengwa__*__ Chief Operating Officer__*__ Tate & Lyle said__*__ “The decision to begin this consultation process was a difficult one to take and we are grateful for the commitment and dedication of our colleagues at the Selby plant over the years. 

This consultation follows a thorough review of the long term prospects of our UK citric acid business. Despite the best efforts of the team at Tate & Lyle to reduce costs__*__ continuing pricing pressures mean that our UK citric acid business can no longer compete viably in an increasingly difficult market.” 

In addition to pricing pressures__*__ production of citric acid at Selby has been adversely affected by changes to the EU sugar regime (which became effective from 1 July 2006) which increased substrate costs.

Tate & Lyle will make every effort to help those colleagues potentially affected find suitable alternative employment. This will include the provision of on-site job shop facilities staffed by independent professional counsellors.

In the year to 31 March 2006__*__ Tate & Lyle’s UK citric acid business at Selby (i.e. excluding astaxanthin) returned sales of £26m and an operating loss of £2m. Tate & Lyle will continue to serve customers from existing inventory and operations in the US__*__ Brazil and Colombia. ENDS

74,auto,Legacy Import,1/29/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle ENRICH® makes bakery better for you,"Tate & Lyle today announced the launch of new ingredient systems for cereal bars and sandwich crackers__*__ as part of the ENRICH™ service for bakery products. Tate & Lyle ENRICH® helps manufacturers create products that are packed with nutrients but taste as good as regular brands. Research (1) predicts a total market growth of 15% for bakery products in the health and wellness category in Western Europe__*__ and 28% in the US__*__ between 2005 and 2010.

ENRICH™ is focused on three main areas - Digestive Health and Immunity__*__ Obesity and Weight Management__*__ and Children’s Health.

The prototypes launched today demonstrate Tate & Lyle’s technical capabilities and reflect current consumer trends. Tate & Lyle will be working closely with customers across a wide range of bakery products. The new ingredient systems can be customised to include specific functional ingredients and to meet the taste preference of the relevant geography.

Cereal Bar ENRICH™ forms part of the Weight Management and Obesity platform. Fibre and protein can aid satiety__*__ helping people to feel fuller for longer and reduce snacking between meals. Cereal bars made using Cereal Bar ENRICH™ contain much higher levels of dietary fibre and protein than many bars on the market. Analysis of snack__*__ cereal and energy bars that have been commercialised in the US over the last three years suggests that only 10% were excellent or good sources of both protein and fibre2. In addition__*__ Tate & Lyle’s ENRICH™ bars are also lower in calories__*__ fat and sugars. 

Cereal Bar ENRICH™ prototypes contain B Vitamins (including thiamin__*__ riboflavin and niacin)__*__ which are considered to be useful for a healthy metabolism__*__ calcium__*__ as well as the important antioxidants Vitamin A__*__ C and E. 

In the EU__*__ Tate & Lyle’s bars made with Cereal Bar ENRICH™ can be labelled ‘high in fibre’__*__ a ‘source of protein’ and a ‘source of’ the included vitamins. In the US__*__ such bars qualify for an ‘excellent source’ claim for fibre__*__ and a ‘good source’ claim for protein and the contained vitamins.

Sandwich Cracker ENRICH™ ingredient systems have been formulated for the Digestive Health and Immunity Platform and are available for both a cracker layer and cracker filling. Finished crackers made using both Sandwich Cracker ENRICH™ systems contain six grams of dietary fibre per 38 gram serving__*__ which is approximately 24% of the daily recommended dietary fibre intake__*__ which makes the product an excellent source of fibre. Alternatives currently on the market typically offer one gram of fibre or less per serving and are often higher in calories and fat. The filling system contains fibre with prebiotic properties and can also contain probiotic culture__*__ both of which are believed to be beneficial to the body’s digestive and immune system. The ingredient system is suitable for use in Cheese__*__ Jalapeno Cheese and Peanut Butter fillings. 

Tate & Lyle’s consumer insight study shows that digestive health becomes increasingly important with age; while parents are especially concerned with their children’s immune systems. Fibre is the key to digestive health for consumers. While they understand the benefits__*__ there is concern that there must be no compromise to taste.

Mike Augustine__*__ Global Vice President__*__ Food Ingredient Applications and Technical Service__*__ says__*__ “Crackers made with Sandwich Cracker ENRICH™ are light and crispy and have a sumptuous filling. They are not only delicious but they also help consumers meet the recommended daily intake of dietary fibre without compromising flavour or texture. In addition to bringing these benefits to consumers__*__ crackers made with Sandwich Cracker ENRICH™ can be processed by manufacturers under standard conditions.”

Per 38 gram serving__*__ crackers made with Sandwich Cracker ENRICH™ contain 170 Kcal and 9 grams of fat. Crackers made with Sandwich Cracker ENRICH™ are also trans-fat free__*__ with the filling system allowing the use of 100% vegetable oil. 

To support ENRICH™__*__ Tate & Lyle is developing a broad range of branded soluble and insoluble fibres. Tate & Lyle’s research shows that 67% of US respondents rate fibre as useful in helping to maintain or control digestive health and the immune system. In the UK and Germany__*__ 66% agree with this statement__*__ in France 61%. 

“Tate & Lyle’s own research shows that consumers understand the health benefits of functional ingredients such as fibre and are keen to incorporate them__*__ as long as this does not mean changes to their diet or sacrificing taste__*__” says Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas for Tate & Lyle. “Bakery products made with our ingredient systems taste great and are on-trend with what consumers are looking for from a nutritional standpoint. Our ingredient systems also offer food producers the potential to address topical health issues and differentiate themselves from their competitors.”

The ENRICH™ service follows the launch of Tate & Lyle REBALANCE® in 2005 and forms part of the company’s CORE™ range of services. Mike Augustine explains__*__ “With our rapid prototyping process__*__ we are doing most of the research and development for a specific product category before approaching the customer. By working closely with our customers from the outset__*__ we are able to help them maximize speed of delivery to market and respond quickly to a changing market place. Now is a great time for food producers to meet our R&D team and see how we can develop an ingredient system that meets their specific brand objectives.”

Tate & Lyle has now begun to share the results of the consumer research and product prototypes across the three platforms with customers.

Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas for Tate & Lyle commented__*__ “Tate & Lyle’s global R&D teams created US and EU customised prototypes in response to growing consumer interest in brands that offer additional health benefits. People often struggle to maintain a balanced and nutritious diet due to lifestyle pressures. However__*__ many consumers are now looking beyond supplements to address specific health needs and have a greater recognition of the nutrients that are beneficial__*__ such as fibre. Providing these in a drinkable form is perfect for people ‘on the go’.

Market research forecasts a potential market growth of 13% in Western Europe and 19% in the US for fortified fruit-based drinks between 2006 and 2009. In response to market data and the Company’s own consumer insight studies__*__ Tate & Lyle is expanding its product offering by developing a broad range of branded soluble and insoluble fibres and by adding a selection of vitamins and minerals to the ENRICH™ systems.

Multi-Fruit Drink ENRICH™__*__ part of the digestive health and immunity platform__*__ adds high levels of fibre__*__ vitamins and minerals to fruit drinks. Made with soluble fibre__*__ this ingredient system is a great source of fibre (prebiotic) and is also designed to work well with probiotic cultures.

Beverages made with Multi-Fruit Drink ENRICH™ contain SPLENDA® Sucralose and have significantly fewer calories than comparable products on the market but deliver all the taste that consumers expect from their regular brand. Multi-Fruit Drink ENRICH™ prototypes also contain the following nutrients:

<ul><li>Calcium__*__ an essential mineral vital to bone health__*__ muscle function__*__ and nerve transmission.

It is suitable for lightly-carbonated or still flavoured waters. Flavoured Water ENRICH™ prototypes include B Vitamins (essential nutrients that function as coenzymes in metabolism of protein__*__ carbohydrates and fat)__*__ Vitamins A and E__*__ as well as various minerals. The added protein and fibre aids satiety__*__ helping people to feel fuller for longer and reduce snacking between meals. The use of SPLENDA® Sucralose in the ingredient system reduces the need for added sugars and lowers the calorie count. With Flavoured Water ENRICH™__*__ consumers can enjoy great-tasting beverages that provide high levels of nutrients and aid satiety. Mike Augustine__*__ Global Vice President of Food Ingredients Applications and Technical Services said__*__ “The launch of Tate & Lyle’s ENRICH™ beverage solutions is ideally timed for customers who are keen to take advantage of the growing interest in fortified or ‘better for you’ brands.

This speed is vital in a crowded marketplace__*__ where customers are fighting to differentiate their products.” 

ENRICH™ is the latest innovative offer from the Tate & Lyle R&D team and follows the launch of Tate & Lyle REBALANCE®. Both are part of the company’s CORE™ service. Tate & Lyle has now begun to take ENRICH™ beverage prototypes to customers.

79,auto,Legacy Import,1/11/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Ventures backs Cambridge University spin-out Lumora Ltd,"Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures today announced its first investment. The Fund has invested in food safety diagnostics company Lumora Ltd__*__ a spin-out from Cambridge University__*__ UK. Lumora has developed a revolutionary DNA-based test that will identify and measure specific food borne pathogens within a matter of hours. The Lumora test is extremely rapid__*__ highly sensitive and__*__ importantly for the food sector__*__ cost effective and easy to use. The investment by Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures will enable Lumora to produce its next generation prototypes and install them within a range of food sector companies.<br />
The new technology is derived from years of work on healthcare diagnostics and uses a novel version of the luciferase gene that enables fireflies to glow in the dark. The presence of minute quantities of bacteria or viruses will cause samples__*__ quite literally__*__ to glow under highly sensitive cameras. Not only can the system identify the specific type of pathogen contaminating a food sample__*__ it is extremely sensitive and can measure the precise amount of contamination. The new technology is also cost-effective compared with other DNA-based techniques__*__ and much faster than more traditional culture-based systems &ndash; bringing detection times down from three to five days to a few hours. Lumora&rsquo;s system will enable food companies to bring real-time testing in-house rather than sending samples out to specialist external laboratories.<br />
While the detection platform will primarily focus on bringing cost-savings and efficiencies to pathogen detection__*__ there are multiple applications for the technology within the food sector such as the detection of minute quantities of GM ingredients in products__*__ or in combating growing levels of food fraud by assessing the provenance of natural food ingredients. Outside of the food sector__*__ Lumora&rsquo;s DNA-based detection platform has wide applications in human healthcare diagnostics__*__ animal welfare__*__ and even counter-terrorism__*__ where Lumora&rsquo;s cost-effective approach would be equally attractive.<br />
Lumora was established by two leading academics in the field of biotechnology__*__ Dr. Laurence Tisi and Professor Jim Murray from Cambridge University&rsquo;s Institute of Biotechnology. Prior to the investment decision__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures leveraged the expertise of Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s in-house Quality Assurance team and a range of external food industry experts to help evaluate the commercial potential of the business. The Managing Partners of Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures__*__ Simon Barnes and David Atkinson will join Lumora&rsquo;s Board__*__ with the company aiming to have its prototype food testing platform installed with key customers within 12 months.<br />
Simon Barnes of Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures said &rdquo;We are delighted to be backing a company based on such strong science and technology__*__ and robust intellectual property__*__ which has the potential to transform not just food safety but also impact a range of other business sectors. Laurence Tisi and Jim Murray have established a business with great potential and we believe the Tate &amp; Lyle link can add real value to this business.&rdquo; <br />
David Atkinson__*__ also of Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures said__*__ &ldquo;Given the cost-pressures faced by food manufactures today__*__ together with recent food scares and the reputational and financial costs of a product recall__*__ this new technology is extremely relevant. By bringing cost and time efficiencies to food manufacturing__*__ Lumora is an excellent fit with the focus of the fund.&rdquo; The fund strategy reflects Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s drive for growth through innovations in bio-materials__*__ next-generation food ingredients__*__ industrial ingredients and bio-fuels.<br />
Laurence Tisi of Lumora said__*__ &ldquo;In addition to providing finance to accelerate Lumora&rsquo;s product development__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures brings valuable expertise in the food sector. The combination of Lumora&rsquo;s unique technology with the backing of Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures ideally positions Lumora to make a major impact on the food sector__*__ benefiting consumers and food producers alike.&rdquo;<strong> <br />

On December 5 2006__*__ New York’s Board of Health voted in favor of a ban on trans-fats in all of the city's restaurants. It is the first large city in the US to strictly limit the use of trans-fats in restaurants.

With its wide range of ingredients and expertise in the reformulation of foods__*__ Tate & Lyle is able to support food service businesses wanting to meet these new regulations with healthy yet delicious options on their menu. 

Tate & Lyle recently worked with the highly experienced research chef Forrest Waldo on a range of reduced calorie desserts for the casual dining food service industry.

85,auto,Legacy Import,12/18/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,2007 Calendar Year Pricing Rounds,"Tate & Lyle issues the following routine update regarding the 2007 calendar year pricing rounds.

Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas has substantially completed the negotiation of its 2007 calendar year sales contracts. There was a small loss in sweetener volume as it sought to increase margins in a rising corn market at the end of the negotiating period. Total sweetener margins for the 2007 calendar year are expected to be higher__*__ much as anticipated. We also anticipate achieving higher total net margins on both value added food and industrial ingredients. 

Our expectations for margins on ethanol sales__*__ which represent a small proportion of Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas’ overall sales__*__ remain consistent with our assumptions for our new facility in Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa. Higher corn costs and lower gasoline prices mean that 2007 ethanol margins are expected to be substantially lower than those achieved in the current financial year. 

Recent comments from the EU Agriculture Commissioner regarding the slow surrender of quota to the restructuring fund have heightened concerns over a continuation of oversupply of sugar in the sugar year ending 30 September 2008. Against this background__*__ we now think it unlikely that any recovery in sugar pricing will occur during the 2007 calendar year. This reinforces our decision to surrender beet sugar quota at Eastern Sugar__*__ where negotiations are ongoing.

The pricing round for Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe is (as is normal for this time of year) at an early stage. So far satisfactory progress is being made to recover higher raw material and energy costs.

89,auto,Legacy Import,11/27/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products Begin Bio-PDO™ Production in Tennessee,"LOUDON__*__ Tenn.__*__ Nov. 27__*__ 2006 – DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products__*__ LLC__*__ an equally owned joint venture of DuPont and Tate & Lyle__*__ today announced the first commercial shipments of Bio-PDO™ from its $100 million facility here. The Loudon facility produces 1__*__3-propanediol (Bio-PDO™) from renewable resources – in this case corn sugar – making it the first facility in the world to manufacture this new bio-based product.

The joint venture uses a proprietary fermentation process developed jointly by DuPont and Tate & Lyle to produce Bio-PDO™ using corn instead of petroleum-based feedstocks. The production of Bio-PDO™ consumes 40 percent less energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent versus petroleum-based propanediol. Production of 100 million pounds of Bio-PDO™ will save the energy equivalent of 13.5 million gallons of gasoline per year__*__ or enough to fuel 24__*__000 cars annually. 

“Bio-PDO™ is a versatile ingredient for a number of products including specialty polymers such as Sorona®__*__ and also is well suited for cosmetics__*__ liquid detergents and industrial applications like anti-freeze__*__” said DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products President Steven Mirshak. “We are seeing strong demand for all of our grades of Bio-PDO™ due to its performance__*__ biodegradable nature__*__ and ability to replace petroleum-derived products. Wherever a glycol is being used today__*__ businesses should consider replacing it with our new renewable ingredient.”

“The first shipments of Bio-PDO™ from Loudon mark the beginning of the commercial availability of DuPont’s bio-based pipeline__*__ which is designed to deliver high performance__*__ renewably sourced materials__*__” said DuPont Executive Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer Thomas M. Connelly. “The technology that was developed to make the various grades of Bio-PDO™ a reality holds great promise. It is a clear demonstration that this new technology can offer new opportunities for products in every major market segment in our economy.”

D. Lynn Grider__*__ President of Tate & Lyle’s U.S. Food & Industrial Ingredients Division__*__ said__*__ “Tate & Lyle scientists have been developing products from renewable resources such as corn__*__ wheat and sugar for over 80 years and Bio-PDO™ is an excellent addition to our industrial ingredient portfolio. By continuing to invest in research__*__ and through strategic partnerships__*__ we can help meet the world’s increasing demand for products from renewable resources that match or exceed the functionality of petroleum-based alternatives. Achieving first commercial shipment is a significant milestone for the joint venture and marks the important move from theoretical to practical.”

The first shipments of Bio-PDO™ were sent to DuPont for the manufacture of DuPont™ Sorona® polymer and to a customer evaluating a new industrial product formulated with Bio-PDO™. Bio-PDO™ can be used in a variety of applications__*__ either by itself or as an ingredient in the production of materials that have traditionally been based on petroleum feedstocks. 

The joint venture also announced the launch of two new brand names for Bio-PDO™. Zemea™ propanediol will be the name of products introduced in the personal care and liquid detergent categories where the products’ purity level and low irritation are benefits. For industrial applications such as de-icing fluids__*__ anti-freeze and heat transfer fluids where its low toxicity and biodegradability are beneficial__*__ Bio-PDO™ will be branded Susterra™ propanediol. To learn more about Bio-PDO™__*__ Susterra™ or Zemea™ corn-derived propanediol__*__ call 1-866-404-7933.

Bio-PDO™ also is a key ingredient for Sorona®__*__ DuPont’s newest polymer family. Sorona® is a high-performance polymer that offers a unique combination of attributes in a variety of applications. As a carpet fiber__*__ Sorona® provides permanent stain protection in addition to softness and durability. In apparel__*__ Sorona® contributes exceptional softness__*__ comfort stretch and recovery__*__ easy care and UV- and chlorine-resistance. Sorona® is currently sold in the residential carpet market by Mohawk Industries under the SmartStrand™ with DuPont™ Sorona® polymer brand. It also can be used in a variety of other applications including automotive and home furnishings__*__ packaging and engineering thermoplastic resins. Today__*__ Sorona® is made from petrochemical building blocks. Manufacture of Sorona® using Bio-PDO™ will begin in early 2007__*__ providing the added feature of approximately 40 percent renewable content.

Tate & Lyle uses innovative technology to transform corn__*__ wheat and sugar into value-added ingredients for customers in the food__*__ beverage__*__ pharmaceutical__*__ cosmetic__*__ paper__*__ packaging and building industries.

98,auto,Legacy Import,10/25/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle to Explore the Full or Partial Disposal of its European Starch Operations,"Tate & Lyle announces that__*__ following the EU’s adoption of a new regulatory regime for the sugar industry which took effect on 1 July 2006__*__ Tate & Lyle has reviewed its plans for the future of its Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe division (“TALFIIE” or “the business”) and has concluded that ownership of the business is no longer an essential element of its strategy to focus on value added ingredients. 

Tate & Lyle is therefore exploring the possibility of the full or partial disposal of TALFIIE. 

Tate & Lyle believes that the interests of TALFIIE and its employees may be best served by the transfer of all or part of the business to an owner whose objectives and strategy are more closely aligned with the business and its investment opportunities. 

Tate & Lyle will continue to develop its value added food ingredients business in Europe through its Global Food Ingredients Group__*__ which includes Cesalpinia Foods Srl. As previously advised__*__ Tate & Lyle will continue to seek to supplement its value added business through the further acquisition of bolt-on ingredient companies.

Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive of Tate & Lyle said ""The decision to explore a full or partial disposal of Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe is in response to the consequences of far reaching reform to the EU sugar regime and builds on the recently announced consultation on the surrender of quota in our Eastern Sugar joint venture. Today’s announcement reflects our strategic commitment to focus on growing our value added ingredients business.”

Further announcements will be made as appropriate.

99,auto,Legacy Import,10/16/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,"""Seeing Is Believing"" – Tate & Lyle’s Chief Executive encourages top business leaders to transform the future of Newham’s youth","Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive of Tate & Lyle__*__ led a group of 20 top executives from FTSE 350 companies and other organisations on a half-day tour around Newham on Tuesday__*__ 10 October__*__ as part of The Prince’s Seeing is Believing Programme (SIB). SIB is one of Business in the Community’s (BITC) flagship programmes__*__ initiated by HRH The Prince of Wales__*__ that gives senior business leaders the opportunity to explore contemporary social issues and the various ways in which business can play an active role in tackling these problems. 

The group__*__ which included executives from companies such as Cisco__*__ Oracle__*__ Citigroup__*__ GlaxoSmithKline and Kellogg’s__*__ visited several youth-related projects and institutions around the borough__*__ including the London Sports Forum for Disabled People__*__ Brampton Manor School__*__ Community Links CBS (Confidence Belief and Self Awareness) Centre and the Newham Sports Academy. By speaking to young people involved with or benefiting from these organisations and services__*__ the business leaders learned how the engagement of their business can contribute to the regeneration of disadvantaged communities in London and also how young people are looking towards 2012 as an opportunity for tackling these issues.

""The visit today showed us some of the biggest challenges faced by communities in East London and the optimism surrounding London 2012. We had open and interesting discussions with young people in the area for whom London 2012 is a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform their future. Businesses like ours can and should play a role in this change__*__"" said Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive of Tate & Lyle. ""I am very pleased that so many leaders from other companies joined me today because what we have heard and seen has been inspiring. I hope that many of us will get even more involved and find ways to build on the good work that has already been done here in Newham. Providing sustainable long-term support will bring benefits for both the community and the companies involved.""

""Seeing is Believing means that business leaders can see for themselves the issues that need addressing and they come away with a much clearer picture of how their business can enable positive change__*__"" added Rowan Earl__*__ National Programme Manager of SIB__*__ BITC. ""The areas designated as regeneration sites for the 2012 London Olympics are in the top 10% of the most deprived boroughs in the UK and represent a diverse range of communities experiencing varying levels of exclusion and disadvantage. The role of business in the regeneration of the area and in the creation of new opportunities for young people must not be underestimated. We know that opportunities to invest in and support the development of the nation’s plan for 2012 will continue to grow."" 

HRH The Prince of Wales founded the SIB programme 15 years ago. Since then more than 4__*__500 business leaders have been involved on more than 450 visits__*__ and about 70 per cent of the leaders report that they changed the way they do business as a result of their Seeing is Believing visit.

100,auto,Legacy Import,10/10/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle to Exit Eastern Sugar Beet Processing Operations in Central Europe under EU Restructuring Fund,"Tate & Lyle announces that Eastern Sugar (“ES”)__*__ its joint venture with Saint Louis Sucre SA (a subsidiary of Suedzucker AG) in which Tate & Lyle owns 50%__*__ has today begun the consultation process with employees__*__ beet growers and other stakeholders with a view to renouncing its quotas in Hungary__*__ Czech Republic and Slovakia and applying to the restructuring fund for compensation. This action has been taken following an extensive review of the impact of the new EU Sugar regime on the ES business.



ES was formed in 1991 and consists of three separate operating companies in Hungary__*__ Czech Republic and Slovakia with a total of approximately 800 employees. It operates five beet processing plants and holds combined annual quotas of 280__*__699 tonnes of sugar. As required under EU legislation__*__ ES will submit restructuring plans to each Government to secure compensation from the EU restructuring fund for the closure of all of these plants and the clearance of the sites.

The ES consultation proposals envisage that the plants will cease processing beets by the end of February 2007__*__ when all of the current campaigns will have been completed__*__ although sugar production will continue for several months at one Czech facility. If the consultation proceeds satisfactorily__*__ a formal application for restructuring aid will be lodged towards the end of November 2006__*__ with the final decision on the grant of restructuring aid expected at the end of February 2007. 



Stanley Musesengwa__*__ Chief Operating Officer of Tate & Lyle said “This step is a direct consequence of the EU Commission’s reform of the sugar regime which provides a compensatory framework to encourage the early surrender of EU sugar quotas in order to bring EU sugar production__*__ and particularly exports__*__ within the limits imposed by the World Trade Organisation.



“This is the right time to enter into this consultation as the business will inevitably face significant further pressure as the progressively negative impacts of reform of the sugar regime take effect on ES over the next three years. ES would also remain exposed to the possibility of further quota cuts being imposed by the EU across the industry in the event that the voluntary surrender of quota is not successful in obtaining a balance of supply and demand in the EU sweetener market. The EU Commission is monitoring the working of the restructuring fund and will deliver a report on progress by the end of 2008.



“ES’s achievements in Czech Republic__*__ Hungary and Slovakia have been made possible by the hard work and ingenuity of our employees and the support of our farmers and suppliers. We are very mindful of the impact on our workforce and beet growers__*__ whom we thank for their commitment and dedication over the last fifteen years. We have achieved an excellent start to our beet campaign this year in all of the ES locations and we are sure that we can rely on the continuing support of our employees and suppliers as we all adapt to the realities of the new EU sugar regime.” 

<br/>

<strong>FINANCIAL EFFECTS</strong>



Tate & Lyle recorded an operating profit of £10 million from its share of ES in the year ended 31 March 2006__*__ the last full year before the reform of the sugar regime. Tate & Lyle’s share of fixed assets at that date was approximately £19 million. 



Subject to the availability of sufficient funds__*__ compensation from the EU restructuring fund is payable at €730 per tonne of quota surrendered. This amounts to a gross__*__ pre tax value of £139 million (€205) million for 100% of ES’s quota. The EU regulations governing surrender require that a proportion of this amount is allocated to beet growers and machinery contractors. This must be a minimum of 10% of the total and a number of precedent transactions have been concluded at or very near that level. The likely final value of compensation payable to ES cannot be determined with any degree of accuracy until the consultation process has been concluded with all stakeholders and the final redundancy__*__ site decommissioning and associated costs are known__*__ likely around the end of November 2006. A further announcement will be made when appropriate. 



Under the regulations__*__ 40% of the compensation will be due to be paid in June 2008 and 60% in February 2009.

Please note this is a change of date from that previously advised. <br /><br />Overall trading since the update issued at the Annual General Meeting on 19 July 2006__*__ and reaffirmed at our Value Added seminar on 7 September 2006__*__ has continued to be in line with our expectations. We have started the year strongly. <br /><br />Over the five months to 31 August 2006__*__ Group profit before tax and amortisation has comfortably exceeded the corresponding period of the prior year__*__ before the benefit of lower depreciation as a result of the asset impairment in Ingredients Europe in the year to March 2006. <br /><br />Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas has demonstrated a strong performance across most categories. Value added food and industrial ingredients__*__ commodity sweeteners and ethanol all achieved both volume and margin gains. Our UK fermentation business has been adversely affected by changes to the EU sugar regime__*__ which have increased substrate costs for both our citric acid and Astaxanthin facilities. As expected__*__ small start-up losses have been incurred at the Bio-PDOTM joint venture in Loudon__*__ Tennessee where plant commissioning is underway. <br /><br />The resolution of the trade dispute on sweeteners with Mexico__*__ which will lead to free trade for US high fructose corn syrup into Mexico from 1 January 2008__*__ is good for industry fundamentals as we approach the sweetener pricing round for calendar 2007. Our intention in those negotiations is to improve margins again. <br /><br />Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe has performed in line with our expectations and trading profits are modestly below the corresponding period of the prior year. However__*__ this has been more than offset by the benefit from lower depreciation as a result of the impairment charge taken in the year to 31 March 2006 (which will reduce the depreciation charge by £25 million in the year to March 2007). Higher prices for both main products and co-products were offset by the impact of higher cereal prices and energy costs. <br /><br />Good growth was achieved in value added food and industrial ingredients. As advised in the preliminary announcement of results on 25 May 2006__*__ trading profits in the second half-year of the financial year ending March 2007 are expected to be significantly lower than in the corresponding period of the prior year. <br /><br />The doubling of SPLENDA® Sucralose capacity in Alabama is now mechanically complete and production ramp up is currently underway. In Singapore__*__ construction of the new facility is on schedule for mechanical completion in January 2007. We continue to expect sales for the year to 31 March 2007 to remain strong__*__ with growth weighted to the second half. Our market approach continues to broaden as we develop SPLENDA® Sucralose sales. <br /><br />In Sugars__*__ Europe__*__ as expected__*__ profitability in our EU sugar refining business has been affected by lower domestic sales prices. This profit reduction has been partially offset by another good performance in sugar trading. <br /><br />In Sugars__*__ Americas__*__ the mark-to-market gains seen last year in Canada have reversed and the performance of the division is below the corresponding period of the prior year. Reported results will reflect changes in exchange rates__*__ particularly the US dollar where the period average rate for the six months to 30 September 2006 was US$1.85 compared to the US$1.79 reported for the year ended 31 March 2006. <br /><br />Overall__*__ we have started the year strongly and our expectations for the full financial year to 31 March 2007 remain unchanged. We continue to view the future with confidence and remain committed to our target for the profit contribution from total value added products to increase by 30% in the year to March 2007. <br /><br />A conference call for analysts and investors will be held at 9.30 am today. The call will be hosted by Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive__*__ John Nicholas__*__ Group Finance Director and Mark Robinson__*__ Director of Investor Relations. Participants are requested to dial in at least 5 minutes before the commencement of the call. <br /><br />Dial in details are: <br /><br />Participant dial in number: +44(0)20 7138 0836 <br />Replay telephone number: +44(0)20 7784 1024 <br />Replay passcode: 4343705# <br /><br />The replay of this call will be available for 7 days until 9 October 2006.</p>,
112,auto,Legacy Import,10/3/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Crystal Cream & Butter Company succeeds with Tate & Lyle-“rebalanced” yogurts,"Crystal Cream & Butter Company<a href='http://www.tateandlyle.presscentre.com/backstage/contentmanagement/otherareas/' target='_blank'>__*__ </a>a full-line__*__ dairy foods manufacturing company based in Sacramento__*__ CA__*__ is a great example of how Tate & Lyle’s US food ingredients team (based in Decatur__*__ Illinois) can help customers launch new products or revitalize their brands to help increase sales and profits. At Tate & Lyle’s Value Added Seminar on 7 September__*__ analysts and investors watched a customer case study that demonstrated the commercial benefits that Tate & Lyle’s ingredient solutions can bring customers.

In 2005__*__ Crystal Creamery launched a new fat-free__*__ reduced-sugar yogurt__*__ which incorporates a customised Tate & Lyle REBALANCE® ingredients solution. This new non-fat__*__ reduced-sugar yogurt contains SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ which enables the company to use the SPLENDA® logo on the packaging__*__ as well as other Tate & Lyle ingredients. Tate & Lyle’s food scientists and technical service team worked closely with Crystal Cream to tailor an existing Yogurt REBALANCE™ solution system and achieve a final product that met their targets.

David Walker__*__ Vice President__*__ Sales & Marketing__*__ is thrilled by the success the new Crystal Cream yogurts have with consumers. ""Our sales increase was 70 percent over the launch period__*__ over the first four months as we went into this new product line-up. So not only were the initial purchases strong__*__ but the repeat purchases were outstanding. Clearly the level of market share we were able to achieve and the repeat purchases were a reflection on the quality of the product that we put out there""__*__ he says.

""How would we evaluate their [Tate & Lyle’s] performance? In all the years and all the experiences that I have had in developing new products I’ve never seen a company being able to go from a concept stage to a finished product in such a short period of time. That was amazing to us. It was also very efficient to work with their organization. As we look to develop new products__*__ such as drinkable yogurts and functional beverages__*__ they are one of the leading companies in developing those types of formulations__*__ and we definitely will be utilizing Tate & Lyle to help us__*__"" says Walker. 

""One of the things that has really helped Tate & Lyle become increasingly more effective with our customers is strong consumer understanding. We know from our consumer research that 78 percent of consumers want to reduce fat in their products__*__ and 72 percent want to reduce the level of sugar. We want to share relevant consumer insights__*__ and product prototypes based on these findings__*__ with customers such as Crystal Cream. Through this approach__*__ we can demonstrate how our market intelligence can be leveraged to support the customer’s marketing and product strategies__*__"" says Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas__*__ Tate & Lyle.

Based on this understanding of specific product categories__*__ Tate & Lyle’s food scientists have developed a range of ingredient solution systems which deliver specific functional__*__ nutritional__*__ or cost benefits without compromising the taste or texture of the final product. These solutions are marketed under four services: Tate & Lyle CREATE® (product innovation)__*__ Tate & Lyle OPTIMIZE® (delivering efficiency and cost savings)__*__ Tate & Lyle REBALANCE® (reformulating the health profile of a product) and Tate & Lyle ENRICH® (enhancing nutrition with functional ingredients). 

SPLENDA® Sucralose is a key ingredient in many of Tate & Lyle’s ingredient solutions. Over 115 million people in the US are currently choosing products sweetened with SPLENDA® Sucralose. Consumers love the taste and manufacturers benefit from its popularity and great functionality. Recent research in the US has shown that 4 of out 10 consumers are more likely to select products which display the ""Sweetened with SPLENDA® Logo"".

113,auto,Legacy Import,12/16/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Study Finds American Consumers have a good understanding of what constitutes a healthy diet but struggle to relate it to their own lives,"According to a recent study conducted by Tate & Lyle__*__ one of the world’s largest ingredients companies__*__ American consumers have a good understanding of what constitutes healthy eating but are struggling to relate that to their own eating habits and lifestyles. 

While 76% agreed that they were always looking for ways to eat more healthily__*__ 56% of those surveyed agreed that it was difficult to eat healthily because of the options readily available to them. 

Increased awareness of obesity and health-related issues has been stimulated through extensive coverage in the media and by government sponsored campaigns such as the ‘Childhood Obesity Prevention’ campaign’ backed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The research__*__ which forms part of an ongoing international study__*__ was undertaken by Tate & Lyle to enhance the effectiveness of their own long-term product development and to offer food and beverage manufacturers key insights into the consumer needs that drive their businesses.

<a href='http://www.tateandlyle.presscentre.com/backstage/contentmanagement/otherareas/' target='_blank'></a>The research findings show that there is a clear opportunity for food and beverage companies to make it easier for people to select healthy options__*__ and to deliver nutritionally balanced products that are convenient and more readily available. In short__*__ there is a desire for products that can deliver on consumers’ aspirations to eat healthily without the need for them to switch eating behavior.

Key study findings are included in the PDF attached.

Fat and sugar are the two top elements that consumers believe they should limit to make their diets more healthy diet. 78%of those surveyed believe fat “needs to be limited to have a healthy diet” and 75% felt the same way about sugar. <br/>

<ul><li>Consumers claim to read ingredient labels while shopping to identify fat and sugar content. However__*__ consumers will not compromise on taste__*__ so food and beverage manufacturers must look for reformulation options that taste good.<br/></li><li>Consumers want additional health benefits in their products (for example: added vitamins__*__ minerals__*__ calcium__*__ Omega 3).<br/></li><li>Only just over a third of consumers (37%) believe they are solely responsible for what they eat. When consumers were asked what other influences there are on their diet__*__ popular choices included: family and friends (51%)__*__ brands and advertising (28%)__*__ ”society” (20%)__*__ retailers (19%)*<br/></li><li>Less than a quarter of parents believe they solely influence what their children eat. Additional influences included: family and friends (71%)__*__ schools (40%)__*__ brands and advertising (27%)__*__ retailers (19%)*<br/></li><li>90% of parents agree that they try to ensure their children have a healthy__*__ nutritious and balanced diet__*__ with 64% agreeing strongly. But parents often find managing their children’s diet a complex juggling act__*__ constantly balancing “best nutrition” with the tastes and demands of their children.<br/></li><li>Parents are concerned about brands that target their children - 72% agree with the statement “Food and drinks marketed at children are often unhealthy”__*__ with 46% agreeing strongly. Parents want healthy options that kids will enjoy.<br/></li><li>Almost half the women who say they are on a diet have created their own custom diet__*__ so food and beverage manufacturers have an opportunity to offer a wide range of products that can be incorporated into these “personal diets”.<br/></li><li>Parents struggle to find products that deliver child-appeal as well as satisfy at least some of Mom’s desire for healthy options. While these products do not have to satisfy all of Mom’s nutritional demands__*__ there is an opportunity for those food and beverage manufacturers that can address the most concerns.<br/></li><li>Dairy products possess a combination of functional benefits and emotional appeal that generate very positive feelings with consumers. <br/></li><li>Consumers often make “smoothie” drinks at home using their own special “recipes” or buy them from juice bars. Home-made smoothies are an easy way for parents to get their children to eat more fresh fruit or dairy (or both).</li></ul>*Selected from a detailed list of potential influencing factors. The list of factors was generated based on our understanding from the qualitative research discussions. “American consumers have a good understanding of what constitutes “healthy eating” yet there is a disconnect between what they know and believe and what they actually do in terms of eating__*__“ states Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas__*__ Tate & Lyle. “This suggests consumers focus on taste and convenience over health and that there are significant opportunities for food and beverage manufacturers to make more healthful versions of their products. While these new options must be convenient and readily available for consumers across purchase locations__*__ they must also be as tasty as regular products.” Tate & Lyle’s new range of ingredient solutions CORE™__*__ in particular TATE & LYLE REBALANCE®__*__ is designed to help manufacturers satisfy this consumer demand. REBALANCE™ Solution Sets are co-processed combinations of ingredients that allow food manufacturers to achieve certain goals__*__ such as fat__*__ sugar and calorie reduction__*__ without compromising on taste and texture. The Solution Sets use innovative ingredients like SPLENDA® Sucralose and other Tate & Lyle specialty starches and sweeteners. US Customer Inquiries

The ingredients will be exhibited at the company’s stand (no R68__*__ Hall 4) at the show. 

<strong>Merigloss granular instant starches</strong> are a new range of granular waxy maize based instant starches. They are specifically processed to ensure that the starch granules are not broken during the instanitisation process and they provide improved clarity__*__ gloss__*__ and viscosity when compared to traditional drum dried instant starches. These starches are particularly suited for use in fruit preparations and bakery fillings.

Tate & Lyle’s new polyol range will include <strong>Merisorb sorbitol powder</strong> which is particularly suited for use in sugar-free chewing gum where it ensures optimal gum processing characteristics and organoleptic properties. In sugar-free direct compressed tablets__*__ Merisorb allows a high flavour load without loss of powder flow properties thus ensuring high tabletting speeds and optimal tablet hardness. 

<strong>Meritol maltitol solutions</strong> are suited for use in sugar-free soft candy where they provide optimal soft texture and a clean sweet taste profile. In addition to SPLENDA® Sucralose and STA-LITE® polydextrose__*__ the Meritol maltitol solutions are used in Tate & Lyle’s REBALANCE™ Solution Sets to create reduced sugar__*__ low GI and reduced calorie confectionery and ice cream.

<strong>ThinGum™ thinboiling starches</strong> are a new range of maize-based thinboiling starches for use in confectionery applications. These starches show a wide range of fluidities and are particularly suited to the production of starch-based gums. They will allow starch-based gums and jellies manufacturers to control texture and flavour release__*__ making confections that are hard or soft as required. 

Moving from sweet to savoury__*__ a new range of <strong>MALDEX G granulated maltodextrins</strong> is particularly suited for use in dry mix formulations such as instant soups__*__ instant desserts and cake mixes__*__ where they ensure optimal solubility and reduced tendency to lump. In addition the solubility of these products is greatly improved at low temperature and high concentration__*__ this makes them particularly suited for use in curing brines for meat applications and for the spray drying of flavours.

Tate & Lyle will also introduce a range of <strong>unique new wheat proteins</strong> to the EU market. <strong>MERIPRO 705</strong> is an emulsifying protein that helps customers to stabilize sausage emulsions and improve spreadability of products like paté. <strong>MERIPRO 410</strong> also displays excellent emulsifying properties__*__ and even at low dosage it provides texture and stability in food emulsions such as egg-free dressings and non-dairy whipped creams. Fruit chewy candies can now be made 100% gelatine free thanks to <strong>MERIPRO 420</strong>__*__ a unique wheat protein designed to give stability and firmness to foams and whipped dairy desserts.

This new range of co-processed ingredient combinations will bring significant benefits to European food and beverage manufacturers and will be marketed under the OPTIMIZE™ and REBALANCE™ services.

OPTIMIZE™ is a service designed to help food and beverage manufacturers reduce their cost base either by ingredient substitution or by improving process efficiency. Tate & Lyle’s REBALANCE™ service enables manufacturers to make changes to the nutritional profile of their brands without compromising taste.

<strong>Tate & Lyle Sauce REBALANCE™ 016</strong> can be used in tomato-based sauces and dressings__*__ including tomato ketchup and Sweet & Sour Sauce. By using this innovative Solution Set__*__ which includes STA-LITE® Polydextrose and SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ food manufacturers will be able to remove the added sugar from their product. 

The Solution Set is heat stable__*__ which means it can be used without any changes to the regular manufacturing process. In addition__*__ the unique functionality of Sauce REBALANCE™ 016 helps food manufacturers deliver a low calorie end-product with the same taste and consistency as a regular version. Tate & Lyle ketchup prototypes made with this Solution Set delivered a calorie reduction of up to 56% compared to the regular sugar formulation. 

<strong>Tate & Lyle Fruit Dessert REBALANCE™ 017 and 018</strong> are liquid and dry sweetening and bulking systems that can be used in no-added-sugar fruit desserts and toppings. These fruit-based desserts and toppings (typically 52% fruit) offer consumers an alternative way to enjoy a fruit-based snack__*__ building on the compote and puree market. 

Both the liquid and the dry versions of Fruit Dessert REBALANCE™ 017 and 018 include SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ which ensures excellent process stability and helps to provide the finished product with a balanced sweetness profile and a low caloric value. Tate & Lyle’s prototype strawberry fruit desserts made with Fruit Dessert REBALANCE™ 017 and 018 only contain 67-90kcal/100g.

In addition to SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ the dry solution set includes polydextrose and starch for an optimal bulking effect__*__ which makes it ideal for creating desserts with a fuller body. The liquid version of the Solution Set includes polydextrose and liquid maltodextrin to optimise the texture of products such as purees and toppings without added sugar.

Using Tate & Lyle’s Solution Set__*__ manufacturers can offer consumers low calorie__*__ sugar-free gums and jellies with a pleasant texture__*__ no off-taste and a longer shelf life than other sugar-free products. 

Tate & Lyle will be demonstrating grapefruit__*__ mango__*__ pineapple and strawberry flavoured gum and jelly prototypes at FiE__*__ as well as a transparent version of the gum. 

<strong>Tate & Lyle Cola OPTIMIZE™ 019</strong> is a new Solution Set for cola-flavoured beverages that offers manufacturers various benefits__*__ such as reducing taste changes that may occur in regular cola formulations due to the inversion of sugar.

131,auto,Legacy Import,9/29/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Two New Molassed Liquid Feeds from Tate & Lyle,"Dairy farmers can look forward to including two new specially formulated molassed liquid feeds__*__ designed to meet the needs of high yielding cows__*__ in their rations this winter.

According to Simon Markham__*__ Head of Molasses GB at Tate & Lyle__*__ molassed liquid feeds can play a huge role in ensuring lactating cows perform to their potential. Mr Markham said__*__ “The use of molassed liquids can help encourage high dry matter intakes and maximise nutrient supply to the cow. At the same time they can improve the presentation of diets by ensuring a thorough mix and enhancing palatability. The new feeds__*__ Nutrimol and Promaize Sweet__*__ have been designed to meet the needs of high yielding cows across a range of systems and offer exceptional value.”

Nutrimol is a 60%DM__*__ 12.2 ME and 17% crude protein feed__*__ formulated to combine outstanding palatability with balanced sources of sugars and dietary protein. It contains a unique fruit-based flavour to improve the overall palatability of diets and is an ideal energy source in TMR systems. Nutrimol is easy to handle and remains free-flowing__*__ even at low winter temperatures. Nutrimol is also ideally suited for sheep and beef rations.

The sugar content in Promaize Sweet__*__ a product first available in 2005__*__ has been increased to provide a nutrient profile designed to complement mixed forage diets and enhance rumen synchrony. The new formulation gives a feed which is 65% DM__*__ 12.4ME and 43% crude protein with 30% of sugars as invert. The crude protein content is designed to match the starchy energy sources found in maize and wholecrop silages and the enhanced sugar levels balance the highly degradable proteins in grass silage.

“Many farmers will face some significant challenges formulating effective rations this winter due to most silages being drier than usual with variable feed values. Nutrimol and Promaize Sweet will provide a cost-effective solution in many situations__*__” Mr Markham concludes.

134,auto,Legacy Import,9/27/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Sweet Success,"The famous design that adorns tins of Lyle’s Golden Syrup has been named by the Guinness World Records as the world’s oldest branding. The distinctive packaging has hardly changed since 1885.

The Lyle's Golden Syrup tin is still one of the most familiar sights in British kitchens - consumer surveys show the brand is so familiar that it is instantly recognised by 86 per cent of shoppers.

The Lyle’s story began in 1883 when Abram Lyle__*__ a Scottish businessman__*__ set up a sugar refinery in London. Everyone knew that the sugar cane refining process produced a treacly syrup__*__ but it was canny Lyle who discovered this by-product could be refined to make a delicious sweet spread and sweetener for cooking. This syrup was poured into wooden casks and sold it to his workers and local customers. Word spread fast and in a few short months__*__ a tonne a week was being sold.

Wooden casks soon gave way to large Lyle's Golden Syrup dispensers being displayed on the shelves of grocery stores. Lyle's Golden Syrup was first poured into tins in 1885. Today nearly a million tins leave the Plaistow Wharf factory on the banks of the River Thames each month.

The Victorian-style design of the tin has altered little over the years; although the tin itself was made from strong cardboard during the war years when metal was in short supply.

Abram Lyle had strong religious beliefs__*__ which is why the tin features a quotation from the Bible: ""Out of the strong came forth sweetness"". But no-one knows why Abram chose that particular line – was he referring to the tin holding the syrup; or the company producing it?

The syrup tins were certainly strong. Explorer Captain Scott took some on his ill-fated Antarctic expedition in 1910. In 1956 one of the cans was discovered by explorers with the syrup inside still in good condition.

Dr Kate Thomas__*__ an expert on Victorian Literature and Culture at Bryn Mawr College__*__ Philadelphia__*__ said: “When you slip a spoon into Lyle’s Golden Syrup you are dipping into the nineteenth century.<br/>

“The Lyle’s Golden Syrup tin is itself a piece of history. Its image of the lion and the bees and the biblical quotation__*__ testify to a peculiarly Victorian mix of moralism__*__ industrial drive and budding concern for social welfare. 

“The nineteenth century was the boom era for packaged foods and many of the named brands of biscuits__*__ chocolate and condiments that we still know and use__*__ were developed in the nineteenth century. 

“But Lyle’s Golden Syrup is singular for hardly changing its packaging__*__ and its design is as ornamented and distinctively Victorian as the Victoria and Albert Museum__*__ St Pancras Station or Harrods.” 

Alison Ashman__*__ Senior Brand Manager for Lyle’s Golden Syrup said: “Lyle’s Golden Syrup has gained iconic status over the years__*__ not only because it tastes great but because we’ve kept the original packaging. While we’ve extended our product range and added other formats__*__ we know that the green and gold tin will always have a place on Britain’s kitchen shelves as people are stuck on it!”

Nowadays there is a vast Lyle’s Golden Syrup range which includes the classic tins__*__ easy-pour bottles__*__ maple flavoured syrup__*__ Lyle’s Black Treacle__*__ flavoured topping Lyle’s Squeezy Syrups and jars of spreadable Lyle’s Golden Spread.

And it’s not just popular in this country - people as far afield as USA__*__ China__*__ South Africa__*__ Australia and Yemen are all fans of this classic British product.

GOLDEN SYRUP FACTS<br/>* Lyle's Golden Syrup was first poured into tins in 1885. <br/>* In 1921 the business started by Abram Lyle merged with Henry Tate & Sons__*__ a sugar refining business started by Sir Henry Tate in 1869. The new company became Tate & Lyle. Henry Tate and Abram Lyle probably never met__*__ despite operating refineries less than two miles apart in East London. It was their descendents who formed the business. Today__*__ Tate & Lyle is the only cane sugar refiner in the UK__*__ and the largest in Europe.

* Lyle's Golden Syrup tins are made from flat sheets of tin-plated steel. The flat sheets are rolled from each end to make hollow tubes__*__ and then the base and other components are added immediately before the tins are filled with Lyle's Golden Syrup. They are filled at speeds of up to 240 tins per minute.<br/>* Lyle's Golden Syrup was awarded a Royal Warrant in 1911 and it's been proudly displayed on the tin ever since. <br/>* Today nearly a million tins leave the Plaistow factory each month. <br/>*Well-known as a topping for porridge and pancakes__*__ Lyle’s Golden Syrup also has more unusual uses - make-up artists mix Lyle’s Golden Syrup with red food dye to make ‘blood’ for film and TV scenes.

* The Three Ways House Hotel in the Cotswolds has a ‘Syrup Sponge Room’ inspired by Lyle's Golden Syrup. The bed has been created to look like a sponge pudding with syrup drizzling from it and the room is adorned with Lyle's Golden Syrup paraphernalia - even a standard lamp cleverly constructed using empty syrup tins.

* The Lyle's Golden Syrup brand is worth an estimated £19.3 million.

* Tate & Lyle (who own the Lyle’s Golden Syrup brand) was one of the original companies in the FT-30 index founded in 1935. There are only three constituents from the original FT-30 index still listed today – GKN__*__ ICI and Tate & Lyle.

At Tate & Lyle__*__ we believe the corn fields of today will be the oil fields of the future. So what better place to be than here in the heart of the Midwest__*__"" said Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive__*__ Tate & Lyle.

Mr. Ferguson continued__*__ ""Supported by strong investment in R+D and in new manufacturing plants like Fort Dodge__*__ our scientists are working hard to meet these demands and move towards an ever more bio-based economy.

We’re very proud to be building here and very much look forward to becoming part of the local community.""

The plant’s first phase is expected to be completed by March 2009. 

Webster County Development Executive Director John Kramer said that this is the single largest commercial investment in Webster County’s history. Kramer added__*__ “The magnitude of that statement defines the scope of this project and the impact it will have for our community.”

Collaboration between the company and the university dates back to the 1970s when research by scientists from King’s College London and Tate & Lyle led to the development of the no-calorie sweetener SPLENDA® Sucralose. 

The new ‘Tate & Lyle Health Research Centre’ at King’s College London will include a clinical research facility (based at St. Thomas’) and a carbohydrate nutrition research laboratory (based at the Waterloo Campus). The research will strengthen understanding of how carbohydrates can promote gut health and how different types of carbohydrate can reduce risk of metabolic syndrome (the group of disorders associated with heart disease and type II diabetes). Tate & Lyle’s investment will support new appointments within the Centre__*__ such as a Tate & Lyle Professor of Nutrition and Health and a Reader in Endocrinology and Diabetes. The Centre will also draw upon the clinical expertise at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust.

King’s College London has a strong international reputation for its cross-disciplinary approach to nutrition and health__*__ bringing together expertise in cardiovascular disease__*__ gut health__*__ reproductive health__*__ molecular biology and nutrition. Current research includes the effect of low glycaemic carbohydrates on metabolic syndrome__*__ the use of prebiotic carbohydrates to promote gut health__*__ and the influence of diet and obesity during pregnancy on the risk of offspring developing high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome.

Tate & Lyle is currently developing ingredient solutions under its ENRICH™ service which enhance the nutritional benefit of food and beverages without compromising on taste. These solutions will address current health issues such as gut health (prebiotics and probiotics)__*__ satiety__*__ paediatric health and vitamin and mineral enrichment. 

Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive of Tate & Lyle said__*__ “We are very proud to contribute to the development of this new research facility at King’s College London and to support new research appointments. By combining Tate & Lyle’s commercial experience in the food and beverage industry and King’s expertise in health and nutrition we can share knowledge through the dissemination of our research and ultimately bring new products and technologies to market. This partnership has particular relevance to the future development of our ENRICH service__*__ which has been created in response to increasing consumer demand for great tasting__*__ good value products that enhance healthy lifestyles.”

Professor Rick Trainor__*__ Principal of King’s College London added__*__ “King’s is delighted by the opportunities that this investment brings to improve the health and wellbeing of millions of people in this country and abroad. It also represents a significant alliance with a global business partner reinforcing King’s track record of forming strategic partnerships based on its research excellence. Research with Tate & Lyle during the seventies led to the development of sucralose. We have great hopes for future translational research from this Centre at King’s.”

157,auto,Legacy Import,8/1/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Cesalpinia Food Srl launches new stabiliser products for white meats and egg-free dressings,"Cesalpinia Food Srl__*__ part of Tate & Lyle - a global leader in renewable ingredients - is launching two new products for the European food texturising market. 

The latest additions to the portfolio are Frimulsion MJF for meat and fish applications and Frimulsion E130 and E132 – the first ever hot and cold non-dairy systems for egg-free dressings.

Frimulsion MJF is a blend of carageenan and locust bean gum that when added to brine can be used in marinated or spiced chicken__*__ pork and fish in order to extend the meat. As well as delivering cost savings to producers__*__ Frimulsion MJF also enhances the eating quality of meats. The end product is more juicy and tender after cooking__*__ while weight loss through cooking is also reduced. 

Frimulsion E130 and E132 are ready-to-use blends for use in medium and low fat dressings. The new system is based on emulsifiers (isolated wheat proteins)__*__ stabilisers (xanthan gum and guar gum) and Tate & Lyle modified food starches. Medium and low-fat mayonnaises usually require reduced oil content and increased starch content along with an emulsifier such as dairy protein or egg yolk. The new system removes the need for animal products and avoids many of processing concerns and price volatility associated with eggs. It is cholesterol-free and also has added storage and handling advantages over egg yolk. In addition to avoiding price volatility the solution delivers a cost saving as only a small amount of the isolated wheat protein is required.

Frimulsion E130 is specially formulated for hot processes using a Tate & Lyle cook-up modified food starch. Frimulsion E132 is designed for cold__*__ instant processes - using a unique pre-gelatinised instant modified food starch developed by Tate & Lyle__*__ which maintains a fine granular structure similar to that of a cook-up modified food starch

Elio Tironi__*__ Technical Director__*__ Cesalpinia Food Srl explained: “Our initial findings from the launch of these new products is that they are attractive in emerging European growth markets__*__ where manufacturers are looking to increase cost-efficiencies while enhancing the quality and taste of finished products. We hope to replicate this success elsewhere in Europe. These ingredient solutions represent a real breakthrough for meat and dressings producers and we are extremely proud to have developed the first ever non-egg__*__ non-dairy system for mayonnaise.” 

Tate & Lyle acquired Cesalpinia Food Srl (based in Italy) in December 2005. The acquisition broadened Tate & Lyle’s European portfolio of food ingredients adding stabilising systems and gums and has enhanced its expertise in providing solutions for key target markets such as dairy__*__ soups__*__ sauces and dressings.

The integration of the two cereal sweeteners and starch businesses will give rise to enhanced cross selling and export opportunities and greater efficiency in servicing export markets. <br/><br/><br/></li><li>Research and development: The current ownership structure of Amylum has limited the full transfer of product and process technology between Tate & Lyle and Amylum. The proposed acquisition will enable Tate & Lyle to integrate its research and development capabilities and leverage the respective expertise of Tate & Lyle and Amylum on a global basis. This will greatly enhance development opportunities__*__ particularly in value added products__*__ and facilitate production cost savings across the Group. <br/></li></ul><br/><br/>Financing <br/><br/>The cash consideration for the proposed acquisition will be funded from Tate & Lyle’s existing banking facilities. <br/><br/>Information on Amylum and Staley <br/><br/>Amylum is one of the leading producers of cereal sweeteners and starches in Europe.

177,auto,Legacy Import,9/29/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC - Trading Update,<p>In line with its regular practice__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading update prior to meeting with stockbrokers’ analysts and entering a closed period in respect of the interim results to 30 September 2005. The interim results will be announced on 3 November 2005. <br /><br />Trading since the update issued on 28 July 2005__*__ prior to the Annual General Meeting__*__ has continued to be in line with our internal expectations. Over the five months to 31 August 2005__*__ profit before tax and amortisation has met our budgetary expectations and is modestly above the corresponding period of the prior year__*__ despite higher interest charges as we invest for growth. <br /><br />SPLENDA® Sucralose has continued to enjoy strong demand across all major food__*__ beverage and pharmaceutical categories. Similar to 2005__*__ demand from existing customers is expected to outpace production through the year to March 2006. The expansion projects to increase sucralose production capacity in Alabama__*__ USA and Singapore are on schedule and the related capital expenditure is in line with budget. We are aware that a no-calorie sweetener tabletop product containing sucralose and called “Altern” has been available in one or two stores in the USA. We have determined that the sucralose contained in the product was manufactured in our facility in McIntosh__*__ Alabama. This product has now been withdrawn from sale. <br /><br />Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients Americas has again demonstrated good growth in value added food ingredients. Industrial ingredients have performed as planned in difficult market conditions. Ethanol has benefited from increased margins in recent months. Commodity sweetener volumes have exceeded our expectations whilst margins have been stable. The citric acid product line has contributed increased profitability. Increased costs__*__ in particular energy and transport__*__ have partially eroded margin gains in this division. As expected__*__ small start up losses have been incurred on both AquastaTM astaxanthin and the Bio-PDO (Bio-3G) joint ventures. <br /><br />Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients Europe has achieved higher sales volumes with good growth in food ingredients. This benefit has been partially offset by lower sweetener selling prices and margins following the 2005 calendar year pricing round__*__ and higher costs__*__ particularly energy and transport. These cost increases will affect second half performance and will need to be recovered in the 2006 calendar year pricing round. <br /><br />Profitability in our EU sugar refining business has been substantially reduced with oversupply in the market coupled with the expected higher cost of export licenses. Energy costs were also higher. This profit reduction has partially been offset by a good performance in sugar trading. A fire in our Portuguese refinery resulted in a loss of raw sugar stock which resulted in a small loss in our re-insurance operation. In Canada__*__ performance has been as expected__*__ but below the level of the comparative period. <br /><br />Overall__*__ our expectations for the full financial year to March 2006 remain unchanged. Looking further forward__*__ if prevailing energy prices persist through our financial year 2007 it would increase our costs by around £40 million. We aim to recover this through product pricing. <br /><br />There has not been any new information or clarification on the proposals for reform of the EU sugar regime which were tabled by the European Commission on 22 June 2005. Our efforts to achieve an equitable solution for our businesses continue. We expect the Commission to announce final proposals for the EU Sugar Regime towards the end of November 2005. <br /><br />SPLENDA® and the SPLENDA® logo are trademarks of McNeil Nutritionals__*__ LLC</p>,
178,auto,Legacy Import,9/28/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle nominated for Fi Europe Award. Company is finalist in the ‘Most Innovative Food Ingredient Awards’,"Tate & Lyle__*__ a global leader in renewable ingredients__*__ has been named one of the eight finalists in the Most Innovative Food Ingredients Awards which will be presented at this year’s Fi Europe show. The company has been nominated for its new ingredient Solution Set__*__ Ice Cream REBALANCE™ 004. This Solution Set is a complete sweetening system that includes SPLENDA® Sucralose for use in no-sugar-added ice cream formulations.

Independent research commissioned by Tate & Lyle confirmed that one in four consumers believes that reducing fat and sugar levels are the most important improvements that can be made to ice cream__*__ while 73 % of current ice cream buyers would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ buy a low-fat__*__ low-sugar ice cream. 

In response to that consumer demand__*__ Tate & Lyle developed Ice Cream REBALANCE™ 004. Ice cream made using REBALANCE™ 004 delivers 73% less sugars__*__ 33% less fat and 30% less energy than ‘indulgent’__*__ full-fat and full-sugar products.

Of course__*__ these changes in formulation would be fruitless if taste was compromised in any way - so Tate & Lyle produced prototypes using Ice Cream REBALANCE™ 004 and asked Leatherhead International to use sensory testing to evaluate the product’s performance against 12 leading commercially available products. 

Even with substantially lower fat__*__ sugar and calorie content the ice cream prototype beat all the light ice creams in a range of tests for positive sensory qualities including creaminess__*__ vanilla and dairy. Moreover it matched many__*__ and even beat some__*__ of the sampled indulgence products on the market. The prototype also delivered less negative sensory attributes - such as powdery texture__*__ iciness and off flavours – than all the light and indulgence products they were tested against. 

""We launched the REBALANCE™ ingredient service to help customers retain the full flavours of their original products while meeting the needs of consumers who want to make changes to their diet__*__ such as by reducing fats__*__ sugars or calorie content__*__"" explains Rachel Moffatt__*__ European Food Ingredients marketing manager at Tate & Lyle. ""Ice Cream REBALANCE™ 004 is one of the flagships of the new range and we are delighted it is being considered for an award at Fi Europe."" 

Ice Cream REBALANCE™ 004 reduces calories by replacing bulk sweeteners with a tailored range of Tate & Lyle sweetening and texturant systems. In addition to reducing fat and sugar content while retaining texture and flavour__*__ REBALANCE™ 004 also has a positive impact on the shelf life of ice cream by improving the heat shock stability.

179,auto,Legacy Import,9/21/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,New Liquid Feed will boost performance on mixed forage diets,"Dairy farmers who base their diets on mixed forages will be able to improve the overall balance and cost-effectiveness of their rations by including an innovative new liquid feed from Tate & Lyle. Promaize Sweet is designed to improve rumen performance by providing a balance of sugars and high quality protein.

Promaize Sweet is a highly palatable 45% protein balancer which also contains a high level of natural sugars from a variety of sources to provide a source of fast fermenting energy. It has been specifically formulated to complement mixed forage diets and rations containing low protein feeds. It extends the broad range of molasses blends and distillery syrups already available to farmers from Tate & Lyle which allow the cost-effective balancing of a range of diets.

""With the increased use of maize silage__*__ wholecrop and Alkalage there is a need for a feed which can balance these forages effectively and ensure a high level of rumen synchrony__*__"" explains Simon Markham__*__ National Sales Manager with Tate & Lyle.

The fast fermenting sugars provided by the molasses in Promaize Sweet complement the proteins in silages as they pass through the rumen. Similarly__*__ the non-urea protein is an excellent match for the starch in maize and other cereals. By promoting rumen synchrony__*__ farmers can reduce the incidence of digestive upsets and improve overall performance.

""As with other liquid feeds__*__ Promaize Sweet will improve the palatability of the overall ration and ensure effective physical mixing__*__ reducing waste and the potential for ration sifting by cows.""

The development of Promaize Sweet is another example of Tate & Lyle’s commitment to providing effective__*__ high specification liquid feeds based on its ability to source cost-effective and traceable ingredients from around the world.

""The launch of Promaize Sweet strengthens our range of specialized and value-for-money liquid feeds""__*__ comments Simon. ""With the dairy farming industry facing a period of extensive change__*__ we will continue to tailor our liquids to meet the evolving needs of our customers and provide the best possible value under all market conditions.""

“Although the majority of golden syrup sold is for baking__*__ usage of it as a spread is up 57%*. This launch aims to build on this growth and create a point of entry that will attract new users to the brand. Many consumers are trading up into branded products that offer quality and innovation__*__ so this launch is perfectly placed to tap into this trend. Lyle’s Golden Syrup is a much-loved brand and our research shows 89% of mums would be likely or very likely to buy our new spread__*__” continues Ashman. 

<strong>On-shelf stand impact</strong>

The eye-catching 350g glass jar has been designed to combine a friendly ‘Lyle the Lion’ icon with the iconic green and gold Lyle’s Golden Syrup arch. To maximise on-shelf impact__*__ the product is packed in branded shelf-ready trays of six.

The project is expected to cover the Group’s cost of capital in the first full year of operation.

<br /><br />“These proprietary technologies__*__ which have been developed by Group engineers in Europe and the Americas__*__ allow significantly higher starch yields and lower energy consumption__*__” said Stanley Musesengwa__*__ Chief Operating Officer of Tate &amp; Lyle. “In addition to lower operating costs__*__ the expansion will be implemented at a lower capital cost per bushel than the traditional corn wet milling process and is an example of Tate &amp; Lyle’s experience and innovation at work.

“These are exciting times for the Loudon facility__*__ which is seeing considerable investment and is creating jobs in the local construction industry.

We have announced capital projects to more than triple the sucralose production capacity acquired under the realignment of the SPLENDA® Sucralose activities in April 2004 and our new joint venture plant with DuPont to produce Bio-3GTM from renewable resources should begin to come on stream in our financial year ending 31 March 2007. All of these projects continue to progress satisfactorily. <br /><br />Earlier today we also announced expansion plans for both our Sagamore and Loudon facilities in the US which will involve capital expenditure totalling £100 million. The £43 million expansion to the Loudon__*__ Tennessee__*__ facility will enable Tate &amp; Lyle to increase production of value added products and supply substrate to the Bio-3GTM joint venture with DuPont. It will also increase ethanol capacity by 37 million gallons per year. This expansion__*__ which includes investment in substantial environmental improvements__*__ will not increase high fructose corn syrup capacity. Subject to regulatory permit approvals__*__ construction will begin later this financial year and the new capacity will be operational in October 2007. <br /><br />The expansion to the Sagamore facility in Lafayette__*__ Indiana will cost £57 million and will increase capacity for food ingredient products. This will contribute to the delivery of Tate &amp; Lyle’s strategy to grow the contribution from value added products. The project also includes investment in substantial environmental improvements. Subject to regulatory permit approvals__*__ construction will begin later this financial year and the new capacity will be operational by January 2007. These investments reflect our firm commitment to deliver against our growth strategy and in particular to grow the contribution from value added products. They were substantially provided for in the financial plans for the years ending March 2006 and March 2007.” <br /><br />Sir David Lees__*__ Chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ will also make the following comments at the Annual General Meeting later today: <br /><br />“Many shareholders__*__ but not all__*__ will be aware of the content of the press release that we issued on 23rd June 2005 in response to the publication by the European Commission__*__ the previous day__*__ of new proposals for reform of the EU Sugar Regime scheduled to take place on 1st July 2006. <br /><br />Our response contained the following main points. Firstly__*__ there would be no adverse financial effect in the current financial year to 31st March 2006. However__*__ if unchanged the impact of the proposals would be to reduce operating results by £20 million in the year ending 31st March 2007__*__ £60 million in the year ending 31st March 2008__*__ and £85 million in the year ending 31st March 2009. <br /><br />Secondly__*__ these adverse financial impacts excluded the possible effect of market forces across the range of industries likely to be affected by the proposals. These adverse impacts also excluded mitigating actions that Tate &amp; Lyle itself will undertake in response to actual structural and commercial change. <br /><br />Thirdly__*__ the targeted improvements in operating results from our value added products in the three years mentioned are expected to at least offset the anticipated adverse impact of the Sugar Regime proposals. <br /><br />Fourthly__*__ the current proposals remain subject to negotiation and probable future amendment at the Council of Ministers and final approval in the European Parliament__*__ a process that is anticipated to last until at least November 2005. Our response went on to say that we considered the proposals to be seriously inequitable and that we would be seeking a fairer and more satisfactory outcome in the next few months. <br /><br />This was strong language and I therefore think it appropriate to explain to shareholders why we chose the words we did. As elaborated in our press release last month__*__ the most significant part of these impacts will be felt in our Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe business which produces isoglucose and other products which compete with and are typically priced at a discount to sugar. The price reductions in the proposals will have a significant impact here__*__ particularly as the raw material used in this business is either wheat or corn so__*__ contrary to the position of__*__ say__*__ the beet sugar processors__*__ the regime can provide no offsetting adjustment in input price to sustain margins. Our cane sugar refineries in London and Lisbon would also be impacted by reduced margins as the lower sugar prices in the current proposals would not be fully offset by reductions in raw sugar prices. <br /><br />My remaining remarks today will be focussed principally on the impacts on cane sugar refining. In essence we believe that the proposals as currently drafted are inconsistent with the Commission’s stated undertaking to ensure the refining of sugar is carried out under the fairest possible conditions of competition. In particular the proposals as stated have the effect of reducing the Beet Processors’ margins by 44% but the Cane Refiners’ margins by 77% in 2009/10. Margins for this purpose can broadly be described as the difference between what the Cane Refiners and Beet Processors receive for their finished products__*__ which is the same__*__ and what they pay for their raw materials__*__ which is different. We have pointed out the inequity of the proposals to the Commission and to the Department for the Environment__*__ Food and Rural Affairs__*__ known as DEFRA__*__ which is our sponsoring Ministry and we will continue to lobby hard for the fair treatment originally promised. In this regard extracts from Paragraph 9.3 of DEFRA’s Regulatory Impact Assessment published recently following publication of the Commission’s current proposals make interesting reading. <br /><br />I quote: “Given that the UK refiner__*__ (that is Tate &amp; Lyle) is arguably the world’s most efficient refiner__*__ and is far more likely to prosper in a fully liberalised market than beet processors__*__ there is a strong argument in a partial reform for a corrective mechanism to offset the continued distortions of a regulated price system. This may take the form of a margin aid or ensuring sufficient raw imports enter the community. The abolition of refining aid in the Commission’s proposal (refining aid is currently worth about £20 million a year to Tate &amp; Lyle) means that the institutional refining margin (for the cane refiners) will be squeezed by a significantly greater proportion than the beet processing.” <br /><br />The paragraph in question goes on to say: “Whilst it should not be the objective of a liberalising reform to engineer specific outcomes there appears to be little economic justification for differential treatment between beet and cane.” There are two further points about which I feel shareholders should be aware in connection with the EU Sugar Regime. <br /><br />The first relates to a wide misunderstanding of the purpose of the payment we receive each year from the Rural Payments Authority which in the year to 15th October 2004 amounted to £127 million. The purpose of this payment is to enable Tate &amp; Lyle to purchase raw sugar from the African__*__ Caribbean__*__ Pacific and less developed countries__*__ known as the ACP and LDC__*__ at EU established prices. These are some three times the world price. The important point to realise is that Tate &amp; Lyle does not retain the £127 million. In effect the payment is passed through Tate &amp; Lyle from the European Union to the suppliers in those countries. This enables the European Union to meet its long term obligations to purchase some 1.5m tonnes of raw sugar a year. I would emphasise that the prices at which these purchases are made are currently at about three times the world price. <br /><br />The second point I want to make concerns the dependency of Tate &amp; Lyle’s sugar business on the EU Sugar Regime. As most people will know the Regime has created a highly regulated market with controls affecting both input and output prices. However__*__ shareholders should be aware that Tate &amp; Lyle’s EU sugar business is not dependent on a regulated market for its prosperity. We believe we would compete very effectively in a free non-regulated market as we do with our Redpath Sugar business in Canada. Furthermore__*__ that assertion is not ours alone. <br /><br />Again I turn to DEFRA’s Regulatory Impact Assessment and quote from page 4 which states: “As proposed__*__ the reform threatens a substantial squeeze upon cane refining margins__*__ including in the UK__*__ a sector which is otherwise well placed to compete in a fully liberalised market.” Page 89 of the same publication repeats this theme stating: “Full liberalisation should not pose a great risk for cane refining within the UK.” <br /><br />The issue for us is the manner and speed at which deregulation and any move to full liberalisation takes place. The manner is important because it governs the preservation of the competitive balance between the Cane Refiners and the Beet Processors. The speed is important because of the impact that moving from a highly regulated to a less or even deregulated market has on the participants__*__ not least on our ACP and LDC suppliers. It would indeed be perverse if a participant such as Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ that might be expected to do better than its competitors in a totally deregulated market__*__ were to end up disadvantaged against its competitors in a partially deregulated market. Tate &amp; Lyle fully understands the need for reform of the EU Sugar Regime. <br /><br />Our difficulty lies with the EU Commission’s current proposals which further widen the competitive imbalance between the Cane Refiners and the Beet Processors. As I said earlier__*__ we will be working hard to secure a more satisfactory outcome in the months that lie ahead and I shall be disappointed if we do not have some success.” <br /><br />SPLENDA® is a trademark of McNeil Nutritionals__*__ LLC</p>,

225,auto,Legacy Import,6/23/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC: EU sugar sector reform - potential impact,"Tate & Lyle issues an update following the publication by the Commission of the European Communities on 22 June 2005 of the ‘Proposal for a Council Regulation on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector’ together with other proposals (“the Proposals”).

Tate & Lyle considers the current Proposals to be seriously inequitable and will be seeking a fairer and more satisfactory outcome in the next few months. However__*__ Tate & Lyle believes that it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to provide its best estimate of the potential impact on Tate & Lyle were the Proposals to be enacted in their current form. 

As detailed below__*__ the first year in which the full effect is expected to be felt is the financial year to March 2009 when the potential impact arising purely from changes to the institutional framework is estimated as a reduction in the operating results of around £85 million. 

However__*__ by the financial year to March 2009 Tate & Lyle’s targeted improvement in operating results from value added products would at least offset the anticipated adverse effect estimated above for currently proposed changes in the EU sugar regime. Tate & Lyle has successfully grown the profitability from the value added component of its business over a period of years__*__ achieving a contribution of 49% of profit before tax__*__ amortisation and exceptional items from 18% of sales in the year to 31 March 2005. 

Reform of the EU sugar regime is scheduled to take place on 1 July 2006__*__ in the Tate & Lyle financial year to March 2007__*__ and therefore no impact is expected in the current financial year to March 2006. The financial years to March 2007 and March 2008 are expected to be transition years and the potential impact arising purely from changes to the institutional framework is estimated as a reduction in the operating results of around £20 million and £60 million__*__ respectively. The targeted improvement in operating results from value added products by those years is also expected to at least offset the anticipated adverse effect of currently proposed changes in the regime.

There remain a number of uncertainties and there are three points that should be particularly noted:

- The Proposals remain subject to negotiation and probable further amendment at the Council of Ministers__*__ a process that is expected to last until at least November 2005. The Proposals will also be presented to the European Parliament. Tate & Lyle will be lobbying vigorously with the Commission__*__ national governments and authorities during this period to seek a more equitable outcome for its businesses and raw sugar suppliers. 

- The potential impacts that are therefore being quantified above exclude the possible effect of market forces across the range of industries that are likely to be impacted by the Proposals. It is not possible to quantify this as the interactions and inter-dependencies among affected industries are complex. In particular__*__ an important aspect would be any impact on current commercial premia above the reference price for sugar in domestic markets. The potential impacts have therefore been quantified purely from changes to the institutional framework__*__ being principally changes to sugar and isoglucose quotas__*__ the reference price for sugar (previously the intervention price)__*__ changes to the price for sugar beets and raw cane sugar__*__ and the application of two funding mechanisms - the restructuring fund (which would be used to compensate beet producers__*__ isoglucose and inulin manufacturers that elect to surrender quota) and a production levy (primarily to be used to fund export subsidies). 

- The potential impacts exclude the benefit of mitigating actions that Tate & Lyle will undertake to respond to actual structural and commercial change. 

In comparison to the White Paper of July 2004 (“the White Paper”)__*__ the Proposals in their current form would have a greater impact on Tate & Lyle’s businesses__*__ primarily because of a deeper reduction to the reference price for sugar and the disproportionate and discriminatory reduction in cane refining margins. The following areas would be impacted by the Proposals:

- Food & Industrial Ingredients Europe produces isoglucose and other products which compete with and are typically priced at a discount to sugar__*__ where the raw material (wheat and corn) prices are not linked to that of sugar. The reduction in the sugar price now envisaged in the Proposals would have a significant impact on this business. Food & Industrial Ingredients Europe would have to contribute to both the restructuring fund and the production levy and these costs would also impact upon profitability. Despite the partial compensation of increased isoglucose quotas__*__ the most significant part of the impacts on Tate & Lyle__*__ quantified above__*__ would be felt in Food & Industrial Ingredients Europe. This could be partially mitigated if isoglucose quotas were freely transferable across borders; 

- The cane sugar refineries in London and Portugal would suffer reduced margins as reductions in sugar selling prices would not be fully offset by reductions in input raw sugar prices. Tate & Lyle’s major concern with the Proposals is that margins for cane refiners would be reduced to a greater extent than beet producers such that the competitive imbalance between beet and cane producers would be further widened. This is inconsistent with the Commission’s stated undertaking to ensure that the refining of sugar is carried out “under the fairest possible conditions of competition”. The impact of the Proposals on this business and our raw sugar suppliers would be significant. Tate & Lyle does__*__ however__*__ welcome the security of raw sugar supply through to September 2009 contained in the Proposals__*__ and will be seeking to extend this period;

- Eastern Sugar__*__ the beet joint venture in East and Central Europe__*__ would also see reductions in sugar selling prices and in input raw material prices. Overall we would expect only a small change in the results from Eastern Sugar; and

- The Proposals address the issue of continuation of supply of raw materials at world market prices for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries__*__ and so returns at the citric acid plant in Selby would not be expected to be impacted materially.

Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive__*__ said__*__ “We are deeply concerned about the inequitable nature of the proposals and in particular the disproportionate and discriminatory reduction in cane refining margins. However__*__ it should be borne in mind that the publication of these Proposals on 22nd June is an important step in a process that is expected to continue until at least November this year and the indications are that the final legislation is highly likely to be different in some aspects. As always we are dependent upon the Commission and the Council of Ministers to ensure fair treatment of cane refiners and raw sugar suppliers and to address the needs of the cereal sweetener sector. You can be sure that we will be vigorously representing our position with a view to obtaining a more equitable outcome for our businesses__*__ our raw sugar suppliers and our people. 

“When we have certainty over the final outcome of the regime reform we will be in a position to begin the process of consulting with the workforce of the affected businesses and to finalise our plans to mitigate the impact on our various businesses. We will make a further announcement on developments following publication of the final proposals__*__ which is expected to occur in November 2005.

“We are encouraged that the 2008 mid-term review of price and quota levels envisaged in the White Paper has been removed and that the Proposals provide that the new arrangements would apply until end September 2015. This would give an extended period of stability after the Proposals have been finalised. 

“These reform proposals underscore the importance of the successful implementation of our strategy__*__ which remains on track__*__ to grow the value added component of our business. These include our range of functional starches__*__ SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ Bio-3GTM and AquastaTM – none of which will be impacted by the changes in the sugar regime. It is anticipated that in each of the financial years to March 2007__*__ 2008 and 2009 the targeted improvement in operating results from value added products__*__ will at least offset the adverse effects we anticipate from currently proposed changes to the institutional framework of the EU sugar regime.”

The limited partnership fund will invest in start-ups and expansion stage companies that reflect Tate & Lyle’s drive for strategic growth through next-generation food ingredients__*__ as well as innovations in industrial ingredients__*__ bio-materials and bio-fuels. 

The fund will have $45 million committed by Tate & Lyle at closing. It will be highly targeted and is looking to back 8 – 10 deals over several rounds of finance. Optimal investment sizes are between $2-5million. 

Tate & Lyle has been developing food and industrial ingredients from renewable resources for over 80 years - processing corn__*__ wheat and sugar into value added products around the world. Tate & Lyle Ventures complements the Group’s existing research and development teams and Tate & Lyle’s commitment to build a bio-based future through new renewable consumer-focused products and technologies.

Simon Barnes and David Atkinson will make all investment decisions. Long-term fund strategy will be supported by a Tate & Lyle Advisory Board__*__ giving the fund the ability to tap into Tate & Lyle’s expertise in the rapidly growing area of renewable ingredients.

Simon Barnes has six years’ experience in the venture capital industry__*__ first with the London office of Atlas Venture and more recently with GIMV Venture Capital where he focused on early stage life sciences ventures.

229,auto,Legacy Import,7/21/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle launches Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ – ingredient solution for reduced sugars or no-added-sugars__*__ low fat dairy desserts,"Tate & Lyle__*__ a global leader in renewable ingredients__*__ is launching Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ an ingredient solution for reduced sugars or no-added-sugars__*__ low fat dairy desserts. Developed by Tate & Lyle’s European research team__*__ the ingredient solution is now available for the European dairy dessert market. Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ is suitable for use in a range of milk based desserts with neutral pH including spoonable dairy desserts (such as crème desserts__*__ Dutch Vla and custards) and trifles.

European consumers are looking for new lighter options as part of a healthy balanced diet. 82% of consumers in France and Germany believe fat intake needs to be limited as part of a healthy diet and 75% of consumers claim the same for sugar. Research conducted by Tate & Lyle has shown that 35% of consumers in the UK__*__ France and Germany want reduced calorie chilled desserts. 33% want reduced sugar chilled desserts – rising to 47% for dairy desserts consumed by children.

But importantly__*__ consumers will not compromise on taste. This is particularly true of indulgence products such as desserts because consumers expect a smooth__*__ sweet__*__ creamy eating experience and associate this with childhood memories and happy family occasions. ‘Light’ products which do not deliver these qualities will not be successful.

Available in two forms__*__ Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ 033 is designed for low fat__*__ reduced sugars desserts and 034 for low fat__*__ no-added-sugars preparations. Food manufacturers have been able to develop either low fat or no-added-sugars dairy desserts but have never been able to deliver both reductions together in a non-aerated product. This breakthrough will allow them to achieve that for the first time. Low-fat__*__ reduced sugar varieties are currently on the market – but this ingredient solution enables manufactures to reach a higher sugar and caloric reduction than previously attainable.

Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ contains modified food starch and a blend of speciality sweeteners including SPLENDA® Sucralose. It also contains soluble fibre__*__ which has a prebiotic effect. Compared with traditional full fat__*__ full sugars products__*__ Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ 033 offers a 35% reduction in calories and a 47% reduction in total sugars. Dessert REBALANCE™ 034 offers a 32% reduction in calories and a 59% reduction in total sugars. Both achieve this significant reduction while still delivering a delicious creamy taste and the mouthfeel expected from indulgence products. The use of SPLENDA® Sucralose means that the finished product has an excellent sweetness profile and can offer significant reductions in sugars.

Rachel Moffatt__*__ Tate & Lyle’s European food ingredients marketing manager said__*__ “Our research shows a clear demand for new lighter options. Over the last 12 months__*__ we have developed a number of ingredient solutions within the REBALANCE™ range for the European market to answer that need. Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ is a very important step in the light dessert sector – making low-fat__*__ no-added-sugars dairy desserts a possibility for the first time. Our research and development team has worked hard to make this a commercial reality and bring variety and innovation to the dairy dessert sector.”

Dairy Dessert REBALANCE™ brings significant improvements in functionality for dairy dessert manufacturers. Both versions are supplied as a dry mix which reduces the manufacturing process time. During processing the rheological properties of the dessert mix show little change compared with the full fat__*__ full sugar one - meaning that manufacturers can use the ingredient solution with little adjustment to their processing parameters.

The first quarter’s results were well ahead of those in the corresponding period__*__ excluding the benefit of reduced depreciation (£25 million on an annual basis) arising from the impairment charge of £272 million taken last year. This was due mainly to a continuation of the strong performance from Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients Americas and from sugar trading. <br /><br />Work on our appropriate response to the changes in the EU Sugar Regime continues. <br /><br />Across the business we have a number of expansion projects under way which will stimulate longer term growth in our value added segment. <br /><br />Both of the expansions at the McIntosh__*__ Alabama SPLENDA® Sucralose facility have been completed on time. The first of these is now operating at capacity and the second is in a commissioning period that we expect to last for several months. Construction of the new SPLENDA® Sucralose facility in Singapore remains on schedule for mechanical completion in January 2007. The increased production capacity from these investments will enable us to build further the customer base and SPLENDA® Sucralose brand. We have specifically designed the Singapore plant with the potential for its capacity to be doubled__*__ if required. <br /><br />Our new joint venture plant with DuPont to produce Bio-PDOTM from renewable resources has also been completed on schedule and is being commissioned. This is a unique plant__*__ the first in the world to produce Bio-PDO__*__ and we expect that commissioning and production ramp up will take some time to complete. We remain excited about the longer term market for Bio-PDO which has potential in markets as diverse as apparel__*__ carpets__*__ automotive and electronics. <br /><br />Our other US expansion projects in Sagamore and Loudon and the recently announced investment in a new corn-wet mill in Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa continue to progress satisfactorily. <br /><br />Total investment in these three projects will be some £250 million. This reflects our firm commitment to deliver against our growth strategy and in particular to grow the contribution from value added products. <br /><br />We continue to view the future with confidence and remain committed to our target for the profit contribution from total value added products to increase by 30% in the year to March 2007 from the £161 million reported last year.”</p>,

DuPont Tate & Lyle BioProducts' $100m fermentation plant__*__ announced in May 2004__*__ is now being constructed within the Tate & Lyle Loudon__*__ Tennessee__*__ corn processing complex and will come on stream in March 2006.

The joint venture will upscale this innovative technology__*__ processing corn as a feedstock__*__ to provide low cost and environmentally preferable alternatives to current petrochemical based routes for the production of 1__*__3-propanediol. The total addressable market for Bio-3G™ is estimated to be worth at least US $2 billon per annum.

247,auto,Legacy Import,6/29/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle launches Meritab direct compressible dextrose and improved sieved dextrose grades Meritose 220 and Meritose 300,"Tate & Lyle’s European food ingredients team based in Aalst__*__ Belgium__*__ has launched Meritab - a new direct compressible dextrose. Meritab is designed for use in confectionery products__*__ including candy tablets__*__ mints and energy tablets__*__ and pharmaceutical and neutraceutical applications such as vitamin-enriched tablets. Using a proprietary process developed at Aalst__*__ Meritab brings significant functional benefits to the European tabletting industry. 

Kristien Gerits__*__ Product Manager at Tate & Lyle’s European Food Ingredients team said__*__ “Tablets are generally produced using either traditional wet granulation or direct compression. Wet granulation is a multi-stage process which is cost intensive__*__ time consuming and requires a large investment in capital equipment. Meritab compressible dextrose allows tablet manufacturers to stop using wet granulation processes__*__ and so offers a cost effective and simplified production process.”

Meritab compressible dextrose enables manufacturers to produce consistently high quality tablets with a smooth surface and reduced breakage – increasing efficiency in ingredient usage and delivering cost savings. It has excellent flow properties__*__ ensuring regular machine feeding and low tablet weight variation. Compared to standard tabletting ingredients__*__ Meritab requires less machine pressure to yield similar tablet hardness. This reduces press downtime and increases machine longevity – helping to further optimize the manufacturing process.

Suitable for use in chewable and hard confectionery and medication__*__ Meritab compressible dextrose provides improved mixing properties which allows easy and uniform blending with colours__*__ flavours or other ingredients. Meritab has a clean and cooling taste which is great for confectionery and medication alike. It can help to mask bitter notes of other ingredients often associated with vitamins__*__ plant extracts__*__ minerals__*__ active pharmaceutical ingredients and some high intensity sweeteners.

Ms Gerits added__*__ “We applied in-house tabletting technology to evaluate the Meritab powder functionality in comparison to other tablet ingredients. Our findings showed that Meritab provided harder and more consistent tablets in comparison to other ingredients used for direct compression.”

Also produced at Aalst__*__ Belgium__*__ Tate & Lyle recently introduced two improved sieved dextrose grades__*__ Meritose 220 (medium) and Meritose 300 (coarse). These have been launched in response to customer demand for coarser grades of dextrose with less fines. 

Ms Gerits said__*__ “Sieved dextrose is increasingly preferred by customers as it is easier to handle and performs better in many applications. Sieved dextrose does not tend to lump and has reduced dusting__*__ better dispersion and less demixing. Meritose 220 and Meritose 300 deliver all these enhanced characteristics.” 

Both Meritose 220 and Meritose 300 are used widely across a number of food and industrial applications. In foods__*__ Meritose is used as a sweetening agent or in food applications requiring fermentable sugars such as bakery mixes and meat seasoning blends. Applications include confectionery__*__ fondants__*__ spices and seasoning__*__ tabletting__*__ bakery mixes__*__ sports drinks__*__ and baby foods. It can also be used in industrial applications as a chemical building block (chemically pure dextrose or glucose) and it is widely used for the production of ecologically sound surfactants (APG's).

250,auto,Legacy Import,5/24/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Launch Ice Cream Solution Sets for the European market. Lower in calories__*__ carbohydrates and fats - but no compromise on taste.,"Tate & Lyle__*__ a global leader in renewable ingredients__*__ is launching two Solution Sets for European ice cream manufacturers called Ice Cream Rebalance™ 001 and 002 as part of the Tate & Lyle Rebalance™ range. 

Tate & Lyle Rebalance™ is a unique ingredient service – giving brands a healthier profile without compromising taste. Ice Cream Rebalance™ 001 and 002 will enable the industry to offer consumers products that are lower in calories__*__ carbohydrates and fats but have all the taste of indulgence ice cream. 

Recent consumer research indicated that 25 per cent of people want to see lower fat and lower sugar ice creams available in shops. The study__*__ carried out by Incepta Market Intelligence Research__*__ found that 73 per cent of ice cream buyers would probably or definitely buy a lower fat__*__ lower sugar ice cream. Tate & Lyle is enabling the industry to meet that demand for change without compromising on taste. 

Tate & Lyle’s Ice Cream Rebalance™ 001 is a complete sweetening system__*__ which includes SPLENDA® Sucralose. It reduces calories in no-added-sugar ice cream formulations by replacing bulk sweeteners with a tailored range of Tate & Lyle sweetening systems. Ice Cream Rebalance™ 001 maintains creaminess and controls the texture of products whilst reducing carbohydrates by 35 per cent__*__ sugars by 73 per cent and fat by 33 per cent against samples of indulgence and light ice creams.

Tate & Lyle’s Ice Cream Rebalance™ 002 is also a complete sweetening system including SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ but is designed for reduced sugar ice cream and allows higher fat reduction. Again retaining creaminess and taste qualities__*__ Ice Cream Rebalance™ 002 can reduce sugars by 50 per cent__*__ fat by 56 per cent and overall energy by 30 per cent when compared to regular products. Both solution sets reduce glycaemic carbohydrates. 

During independent sensory research both Ice Cream Rebalance™ 001 and 002 were tested against 12 leading products on the market. It was found that they beat all light ice creams in a range of tests for positive sensory qualities including creaminess__*__ vanilla and dairy. Even with their substantially lower fat__*__ sugar and calorie content__*__ the solutions matched many__*__ and even beat some__*__ of the indulgence products on the market in such sensory tests.

Both solution sets were also found to have less negative sensory attributes - such as powdery texture__*__ iciness and off flavours – than all the light and indulgence products they were tested against. 

Tate & Lyle’s Mike Augustine__*__ Global Vice President__*__ Applications__*__ and Technical Service says__*__ “Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in the nutritional profile of products and we can help the food industry rise to that challenge. Many people want to choose products with reduced calorie__*__ fat or sugar claims but they do not want to compromise on taste.”

“Tate & Lyle is working with the food industry and creating new ingredients solutions that can strike that balance. We believe that these ice cream solutions meet consumer demand and can help facilitate increased choice in marketplace.”

All parts of the complex bio-business system will have to be aligned to turn seeds into advanced bio-materials to serve mass consumer markets. ""Bio-technology products cannot rely on being given privileged market access.

""Tate & Lyle brings a renewable ingredients processing pedigree. We operate simultaneously in a commodity arena and a high value__*__ service-driven functional ingredient environment.

Illustrating the enduring nature of this vision__*__ Iain Ferguson turned to an automotive example: ""In 1937 Henry Ford pioneered a way of using soy-plastic in automobile manufacture and declared ‘almost all new cars will soon be made of soy beans’. By 1941__*__ after planting 8000 acres of soy beans and investing $1.2 million he achieved his dream of a handmade car with its body constructed entirely from bio- plastics. Heavily praised at the time__*__ history and changing post-war attitudes ended the soy-car dream__*__ but__*__” added Iain Ferguson__*__ “Ford’s vision has fresh resonance today and bio-technology has never been more relevant.""

Designed specifically for isotonic sports drinks__*__ which replenish water and minerals to the body before__*__ during and after exercise__*__ Sports Drink REBALANCE™ 015 can create more effective and better tasting isotonic sports drinks for the consumer and provide technical benefits to beverage manufacturers. 

Isotonic solutions by definition have an osmotic pressure equivalent to human blood__*__ due to their balanced composition of minerals and carbohydrates. Therefore the balance of these ingredients within the formula is critical. Besides fructose__*__ which is used to enhance sweetness and boost fruity notes__*__ SPLENDA® Sucralose is also part of the blend and creates a technological advantage. Because sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar__*__ and consequently takes up less particle space than many other sweeteners__*__ it enables manufacturers to add more minerals to the product 

Consuming drinks that contain too much or not the ideal kind of carbohydrates during exercise can lead to gastric problems or cramps. Sports Drink REBALANCE™ 015 has been specially formulated based on leading scientific research to provide a small amount of carefully selected carbohydrates at the optimum level. 

Independent sensory testing of prototype sports drinks made with REBALANCE™ 015 has shown a favourable performance on many key attributes when compared with leading brands currently on the market. Significant improvements include a more balanced sweetness profile and a decrease in sour flavour and aftertaste__*__ in off-flavour as well as in astringent mouthfeel__*__ all of which are attributes associated with some existing sports drinks.

“This is the latest in a series of exciting commercial launches from within the REBALANCE™ range__*__” explains Rachel Moffatt__*__ Tate & Lyle’s European Marketing Manager. “Commercial bottlers and manufacturers in countries such as France and Italy are already interested in this solution because it provides them with increased freedom of formulation. This means they can cater for varying taste preferences within different markets and deliver added functional benefits.” 

“The key driver for Tate & Lyle REBALANCE® solutions is to reformulate a product’s nutritional profile without compromise to taste and enjoyment. The pace of change in the beverage industry is increasing and manufactures need to respond accordingly to the demands of today’s savvy consumers. Tate & Lyle has a long and proud history of innovation. We are proud of the research that has gone into the development of this product line – this is a real technological advance and is unique to Tate & Lyle.”

SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ which is made from sugar and tastes like sugar__*__ has improved heat and acid stability over other leading sweeteners and is tooth-friendly (non-cariogenic). SPLENDA® Sucralose is used worldwide in over 4__*__000 food__*__ beverage and nutritional products and is the sweetening ingredient in SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener.

The solution will first be available in liquid form while a dry formula is currently in development.

275,auto,Legacy Import,6/8/2000,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC sells Tate & Lyle Bundaberg and associated businesses,"Tate & Lyle PLC (""Tate & Lyle"" or the ""Group"") announces that it has agreed to sell its wholly-owned Australian sugar business__*__ Tate & Lyle Bundaberg (""Bundaberg"")__*__ and associated businesses__*__ to Belgium-based Société Financière des Sucres s.a. (""Finasucre""). The consideration is A$425 million (£162 million)__*__ debt free__*__ subject to adjustments. Of this__*__ A$144 million (£55 million) will be paid in cash at completion. The balance is being satisfied by a mixture of the assumption and repayment of debt and accrued interest by Finasucre of A$141 million (£54 million)__*__ subject to adjustment__*__ and the payment of pre-completion dividends. <br/><br/>Headquartered in Brisbane__*__ Bundaberg is the third largest cane miller in Australia__*__ operating from seven mills__*__ and is also a significant sugar refiner and a major cane grower. <br/><br/>Included in the sale are: Bundaberg’s raw sugar and sugar refining business; a 50% interest in Bundaberg Rum__*__ which is operated in partnership with United Distillers and Vintners (Australia) Limited (a subsidiary of Diageo plc); and Bundaberg’s engineering business__*__ Bundaberg Foundry Engineering Limited. <br/><br/>The value at 25 March 2000 of net assets to be sold was A$342 million (£130 million). This figure excludes the A$141 million (£54 million) of debt within Bundaberg which will be assumed by Finasucre and forms part of the consideration. <br/><br/>Profit before tax attributable to these net assets (including debt) in the 12 months to March 2000 was £2 million. <br/><br/>Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Bundaberg was written off to Group reserves in 1991. £12 million of this goodwill has now been written back and taken as an exceptional loss in the Group profit and loss account for the 18 months to March 2000. The excess of the consideration over net asset value will enhance Tate & Lyle shareholders’ funds on completion of the transaction. <br/><br/>The sale of Bundaberg is conditional on approval (or no objections being received) from the Australian Treasurer under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeover Act 1975 (Commonwealth of Australia). This condition is expected to be met within one month. <br/><br/>Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce Group debt. <br/><br/>Finasucre has also made an offer to acquire the Group’s interest in Vietnamese cane sugar producer__*__ Nghe An Tate & Lyle Sugar Company (""NAT&L""). Tate & Lyle will review this offer with its partners and the financiers to NAT&L. The offer is subject to the achievement by NAT&L of throughput targets which are expected to take up to three years to attain. <br/><br/>Finasucre is a privately-owned holding company operating beet sugar factories and producing lactic acid in Belgium. The company also owns a cane sugar estate in Africa. <br/><br/>Larry Pillard__*__ Tate & Lyle Chief Executive said: <br/><br/>""The sale of Bundaberg is an important step in enhancing the focus of Tate & Lyle on activities that add value to carbohydrates. Along with other recent disposals it underlines our determination to realise value for Group shareholders. <br/><br/>""When Tate & Lyle bought Bundaberg in 1991__*__ it was expected that future deregulation of the Queensland sugar industry would facilitate fuller integration of Bundaberg’s operations with other Group businesses. <br/><br/>""However__*__ the recently introduced Queensland Sugar Industry Act 1999 continues to require that all raw sugar produced in Queensland is purchased and sold by a central organisation. It therefore seems unlikely that the enhanced returns and value added benefits available from vertical integration would be easily accessible in the near future. <br/><br/>""Consequently we have decided that this is an appropriate opportunity to sell Bundaberg. In doing so we acknowledge the valuable support and commitment of Bundaberg’s management team and employees to Tate & Lyle since 1991."" <br/><br/>Olivier and Paul Lippens__*__ Managing Director and Director__*__ respectively__*__ of Finasucre__*__ said: <br/><br/>""The acquisition of Bundaberg is consistent with our objective of investing in high quality assets in areas of strategic importance in the world sugar market. This is a long-term investment for us and we look forward to supporting Bundaberg’s management and employees in the future development of the business."" <br/><b><br/><br/><br/>for Finasucre: <br/>Olivier Lippens__*__ Managing Director (00)-32-75-71-83-59<br/>Robert Fleming & Co.

284,auto,Legacy Import,2/28/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle to launch MERIPRO 711 – the new emulsifying protein for coffee creamers and fat filled powders,"Tate & Lyle__*__ a global leader in the renewable ingredients industry__*__ is to launch a new solution called MERIPRO 711__*__ it was announced today.

MERIPRO 711 is an emulsifying wheat protein for coffee whiteners and fat-filled powders. It will free food manufacturers from dependence on caseinate in their products__*__ which suffers from volatile pricing. 

The protein will facilitate the development of foods with true “non-dairy” creamer ingredients__*__ increasing the choice for those who must avoid dairy ingredients yet wish to enjoy products like creamed coffee__*__ soups and sauces with peace of mind.

MERIPRO 711 can offer a very high emulsifying capacity and total solubility above pH 5.3. It is offered as an alternative to sodium caseinates in creamers (fat content 30-35 per cent) and fat filled powders (fat content 80 per cent). 

The excellent emulsifying capacity of MERIPRO 711 – equal to the performance of the best caseinates - allows for emulsion with a very fine droplet size__*__ which gives a good whitening effect. MERIPRO 711 based powders are heat-shock stable so are resistant to feathering or flocculation. They also provide a rich creamy sensation and mouthfeel.

In the process__*__ MERIPRO 711 has an homogenisation efficiency at least equal to the best caseinates. As the fat is efficiently encapsulated by MERIPRO 711__*__ stable processing conditions are maintained in the spray drier even when very high fat levels are present in the emulsion. MERIPRO 711 solutions are low viscous and allow for easy incorporation.

MERIPRO 711 is a highly concentrated protein and is very low in carbohydrates. It is classified as an ingredient and as such does not carry an E-number. It is Kosher certified and suitable for vegetarian and halal foods.

Tate & Lyle is the world’s leading producer of wheat proteins. The Company pioneered the use of wheat as an industrial-scale raw material and was the first to develop functional proteins from wheat gluten. MERIPRO 711 is just one of the results of Tate & Lyle’s leading technical excellence in wheat proteins__*__ and the Company will continue its search for new wheat based proteins.

<b>Caroline Sanders__*__ Product Manager Proteins of Tate & Lyle says:</b> “We are delighted to launch MERIPRO 711 at Food-Ingredients Asia-China 2005. The continent has a great tradition in the development of dairy alternatives__*__ for reasons of preference or because of a very high prevalence of lactose intolerance. We believe Asia is potentially a big market for the solution. The product’s great functionality coupled with the immediate cost savings made possible for manufacturers makes it another first from Tate & Lyle.”

Trading since the announcement of our interim results on 4 November 2004 has continued to go well and the outlook for the year to 31 March 2005 has not altered. 

Tate & Lyle Food and Industrial Ingredients Americas (formerly Staley) has substantially completed the negotiation of its calendar 2005 sales contracts. Overall in calendar 2005 in local currency__*__ and despite higher energy costs__*__ we expect at least to maintain sweetener total net margins at calendar 2004 levels. We anticipate achieving higher total net margins on value added food ingredients and other products.

The 2005 calendar sweetener pricing round for Tate & Lyle Food and Industrial Ingredients Europe (formerly Amylum) has been competitive. After higher energy costs we expect total sweetener and starch net margins to be slightly below those achieved in calendar 2004.

We do__*__ however__*__ expect to see a marked improvement in earnings in the year to March 2002. The integration of Amylum’s head office with Tate & Lyle has been completed and several other areas of savings have been identified and implemented.

The facility will be built in two equal phases and will ultimately have a capacity of 300__*__000 bushels of corn per day. <br /><br />The investment is subject to obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and negotiations with both state and local authorities.

This investment will capitalise on Tate &amp; Lyle’s world class renewable ingredients capabilities__*__ alleviate projected capacity constraints in Tate &amp; Lyle’s value added starch facilities__*__ and increase Tate &amp; Lyle’s participation in the rapidly growing US renewable fuel market. 

It will incorporate the step-changing proprietary technology Tate &amp; Lyle is installing in the Loudon and Sagamore expansions__*__ together with new proprietary energy conservation technology. These will enable the facility to be constructed at a lower capital cost than the traditional corn wet milling process__*__ and to benefit from both dramatically increased starch yields and reduced per unit energy consumption. 

<br /><br />The first phase will have a capacity of 150__*__000 bushels corn per day.

This will free capacity in Tate &amp; Lyle’s Sagamore facility (the Group’s primary US production site for starch-based value added food ingredients) to be used for value added modified food starches. The first phase is expected to be completed in the year to March 2009 and cover the Group’s cost of capital in its first full year of operation to March 2010.

The project will not result in any increase in Tate &amp; Lyle’s high fructose corn syrup capacity in the US.

“This investment will double our ethanol capacity__*__ producing environmental and energy saving benefits in the US and reducing American oil dependence__*__” said Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive of Tate &amp; Lyle. “It will also enable us to increase production of higher value added food ingredients at our Sagamore facility.” 

“This new facility will create jobs and expand our US strategic presence into the western corn-belt__*__ increasing demand for locally sourced crops. It also shows how we are building on our research and development and project execution capabilities to grow our business.”

SPLENDA® Sucralose is a no-calorie sweetener that is made from sugar and tastes like sugar. In the food and beverage industry it has enjoyed phenomenal uptake across the globe__*__ stimulating brand extensions and enabling the development of new healthy-lifestyle products. It has also been used extensively in pharmaceutical applications by companies in the United States__*__ having been included in the US Pharmacopeia. Many world renowned companies already use SPLENDA® Sucralose in their products in the United States. Existing applications include vitamin tablets__*__ throat lozenges__*__ and cold remedies. Currently 8% of SPLENDA® Sucralose (by sales revenue) is sold into the pharmaceutical industry__*__ 39% into beverages and 53% into food.

SPLENDA® Sucralose is currently in several European drug formulations. With anticipated increased interest in the European market it is envisaged that SPLENDA® Sucralose will be included in the EU Pharmacopeia in the near future__*__ as European companies start to realise its full benefits.

Mary Quinlan__*__ Manager__*__ Sweetener Technology Development__*__ Tate & Lyle commented: 

“We view this as an exciting opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry as SPLENDA® Sucralose has particular benefits over other intense sweeteners in terms of its excellent stability and sweetness.

“Sucralose has a high-quality sweetness and flavour profile close to that of sucrose and is synergistic with most nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners__*__ as well as polyols. As it is six hundred times sweeter than sugar it does not contribute to the bulk of the product – we know that this is seen as an advantage by some customers for tablet and dry form pharmaceuticals__*__ as it allows more room for active ingredients than when compared with traditional sweetening systems. Also__*__ sucralose works well with vitamins and other active ingredients to mask the bitter notes often associated with them. 

""Furthermore sucralose is a very stable__*__ inert compound that has not been found to interact with other ingredients. In liquid systems it is stable across the range from low pH to neutral formulations and it is also highly heat stable - meaning that it can withstand heat processing conditions such as pasteurisation or UHT without any loss. The excellent stability of sucralose compared with some other high potency sweeteners ensures that the sweetness of the product is maintained throughout its shelf life.”

Using SPLENDA® Sucralose in pharmaceutical applications also offers ‘clean label’ benefits as it has never been a requirement to carry any safety information or warning statements on products where it is used.

Other key benefits of SPLENDA® Sucralose include its suitability for the whole family__*__ including diabetics__*__ pregnant women and nursing mothers. Also__*__ sucralose does not support growth of oral bacteria which causes tooth decay. Therefore it can be used in ‘tooth-friendly’ pharmaceuticals.

The range comes in three flavours – mixed fruit (apple__*__ pear__*__ cherry and grapes)__*__ raspberry and grape__*__ and orange.

Thanks to the zero-calorie properties of SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ the final beverage contains only 12 kcal per 100cl__*__ which come from the fruit itself. 

Lerum is Norway’s number one manufacturer of fruit drinks; having produced fruit drinks and jams for over 100 years__*__ they are also a key own-label supplier to Norwegian supermarkets. Tate & Lyle worked closely with Lerum to develop this unique new range of no-added sugar beverages with 97% pure fruit content and no added sugar.

This privately owned 48 bedroom Cotswold village hotel – famous as home of

The room is adorned with Lyle’s Golden Syrup paraphernalia; in particular a standard lamp cleverly constructed using empty Lyle’s Golden Syrup cans

And__*__ if you’re looking for a cosy den to relax in__*__ then you will not be disappointed with the en-suite bathroom. Inspired by the renowned 120 year old icon found on tins of Lyle’s Golden Syrup__*__ a spectacular life size lion stares out at you from the bathroom wall. The room is already proving to be a roaring success with guests!

If you want to create that special Syrup Sponge recipe at home__*__ here’s how:

<strong>The Pudding Club Syrup Sponge recipe</strong>

120g butter

These will enable food manufacturers to meet consumer demands for reduced-calorie fruit dessert without compromising taste and texture. Fruit dessert can be used in a wide range of applications including bakery toppings__*__ sold in jars as a fruit topping for toast and as a grab-and-go fruit dessert.

The fruit dessert sector has been divided in recent years into three parts: full-sugar products__*__ light products and ultra-light products. While commercially available ultra-light products contain around 90 per cent fewer calories than full-sugar fruit dessert__*__ they have proved unpopular with many consumers because of their jelly-like consistency. Tate & Lyle’s new Solution Sets have a nutritional profile which fits between the ultra-light and light category but deliver the taste and texture of a light product.

“Light and ultra-light fruit desserts have typically ticked all the boxes for nutritional content but disappointed on taste and mouthfeel. We have seen that irrespective of high calorie or sugar reduction__*__ products which do not deliver on taste will not achieve mainstream success. Taste is king. In response to requests from the industry__*__ our European R+D team has developed two new fruit dessert Solution Sets__*__” explains Mike Augustine__*__ Global Vice-President of Ingredient Applications and Technical Services. “Fruit desserts made with our products give a burst of fruit flavour and have a soft__*__ jam-like mouthfeel. By using Tate & Lyle’s Fruit Dessert REBALANCE™__*__ fruit dessert manufacturers can reformulate the nutritional profile of their popular brands and offer consumers a product with the same taste and texture as a light product__*__ but with far fewer calories.” 

Tate & Lyle’s Solution Sets offer a great reduction of calories compared to equivalent full-sugar products while maintaining the fruity taste and pleasant mouthfeel consumers love. Prototype fruit desserts made with either of the two Solution Sets also show good spreadability. These prototypes have been made with strawberries__*__ the most popular fruit on this market__*__ but food manufacturers can use the Solution Sets with any fruit they wish. 

Fruit Dessert REBALANCE™ 018__*__ the dry Solution Set allows a caloric reduction of 48 per cent compared to equivalent full-sugar products and offers a final nutritional value of 67.0 kcal/100g. Fruit Dessert REBALANCE™ 017 is a liquid Solution Set that allows a caloric reduction of 40 per cent compared to equivalent full-sugar products and offers a final nutritional value of 86.0 kcal/100g.

Recent research showed that its distinctive tin and logo are recognised by 86%** of consumers. Traditionally used as a baking ingredient__*__ Lyle’s Golden Syrup’s role in the modern cooking repertoire is changing. Today it is increasingly used as a spread - alongside preserves and honey. 

Designed to drive this trend further__*__ in November 2003 Lyle’s Golden Syrup started to advertise again after 10 years. The advertising campaign successfully reversed a market decline__*__ with sales up by seven per cent compared to the same period the previous year.

According to the Taylor Nelson Sofres Family Food Panel 2003__*__ 41% of all syrup consumption occasions include bread__*__ making it a popular teatime or breakfast food. In fact__*__ 59% of Lyle’s Golden Syrup occasions are with ‘morning goods’__*__ as it is being served with other items such as crumpets and muffins. According to the Family Food Panel__*__ spreading and topping usage of Lyle’s Golden Syrup has grown 57% versus a 2%*** volume decline in the overall spreads category.

Alison Ashman__*__ Senior Brand Manager for Lyle’s Golden Syrup comments__*__ “Most retailers now merchandise Lyle’s Golden Syrup - especially the easy-to-pour 454g bottle - amongst the jams and spreads__*__ rather than the baking products. An alternative approach is to retain the Lyle’s Golden Syrup tins in the home baking fixture and place the pouring bottle with the spreads. Couple this merchandising approach with our communication strategy to encourage spreading/topping and you start to realise the impact this is now having on consumers buying behaviour. 

“We know from our own research that children and adults alike love the taste of golden syrup__*__ which is why it is important to continue driving home the spreading/topping message and providing even more reasons to shop the spreads aisle. The brand is over 100 years old yet it has lost none of its appeal.”

A new advertising burst launched in October 2004 continues to communicate the perfect synergy golden syrup has with morning goods. Based around the strapline ‘Golden Moments’__*__ the campaign further encourages Lyle’s Golden Syrup usage as a spread/ topping.

Ashman continues__*__ “To appeal to time-conscious consumers who are driving the convenience market__*__ we have placed a focus on our easy-to-pour bottle__*__ which also features tips on the label about using the product on morning goods. We see this as a huge opportunity for the future and intend to strengthen our share in this market over the coming year.”

As well as 454g/907g tins and the 454g easy to pour bottle__*__ the Lyle’s Golden Syrup portfolio also includes a Maple Syrup flavour__*__ Lyle’s Black Treacle (454g tin)__*__ Lyle’s Golden Syrup Squeezy (400g bottle) and Lyle’s Saucy – Chocolate__*__ Strawberry and Toffee flavours (400g bottle)__*__ available from all major multiples and independent retailers.

The new plant__*__ which will complement the highly successful existing operation in McIntosh__*__ Alabama__*__ USA__*__ will use a patented manufacturing process and will be completed by January 2007. Once fully operational__*__ the Singapore plant will have a capacity two-thirds of that at the expanded Alabama facility.

The total capital cost of construction will be £97 million (US$175 million).

After an extensive review of alternative locations__*__ Singapore was selected due to its attractive tariff structures__*__ availability of a highly skilled workforce__*__ proximity to key markets and the excellent support from the Singapore Economic Development Board. 

SPLENDA® Sucralose is a no-calorie sweetener that is made from sugar__*__ so it tastes like sugar. Its excellent taste profile and unique functionality as a food ingredient has driven exceptional levels of demand from food and beverage producers around the world.

Together with the previously announced investment in our Alabama facility__*__ the new plant in Singapore will enable us to continue to meet our customers’ needs and better serve a growing global market. 

“The new plant will broaden our manufacturing base and help facilitate improved access to the Asian and European markets. Sucralose has enjoyed success in Japan since the first products were launched there in 1999 and we aim to replicate this success across the region. European Union approval of sucralose was granted in February 2004 and becomes final in all member states in February 2005.

“By January 2007__*__ we will have more than tripled sucralose manufacturing output compared to the level at the time of the realignment of the SPLENDA® Sucralose business in April 2004.

377,auto,Legacy Import,3/29/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Trading Update prior to Closed Period,<p>Before entering its closed period for the year ending 31 March 2006 and prior to meeting with stockbrokers' analysts__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following routine trading update. The preliminary announcement of results for the year ending 31 March 2006 will be made on 25 May 2006. <br /><br /><strong><u>OVERVIEW</u></strong> <br /><br />Since the update on 25 January 2006 Tate &amp; Lyle's trading performance has been generally encouraging. <strong><u><br /><br />MAJOR BUSINESS UNITS</u></strong> <br /><strong><br />Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas</strong> has performed strongly__*__ benefiting from higher selling prices since the beginning of the calendar year (across all major product groups in both the US and Mexico)__*__ and from volume growth in value added food ingredients. All major capital expansion projects are on schedule. Construction continues to progress satisfactorily at the Bio-PDO™ plant in Loudon__*__ Tennessee__*__ and where expansion of the value added facilities is taking place at Loudon and Sagamore. <br /><br />Favourable raw material costs and improved selling prices for value added and most other products in <strong>Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe</strong> only partially mitigated the impact of higher energy costs and significantly lower sweetener prices. These lower prices were caused by an oversupply of sugar in the market and impending changes to the EU sugar regime__*__ as reported in our November 2005 and January 2006 trading updates. <br /><br /><strong>SPLENDA® Sucralose</strong> has continued to perform well although manufacturing costs to date in the second half year are higher__*__ mainly due to increased energy and ingredient costs__*__ and expansion related operational constraints. The first phase of the plant expansion at McIntosh__*__ Alabama is now in the final stages of commissioning. The second phase is on schedule for mechanical completion and the start of commissioning in April 2006. These two expansions will result in a doubling of the McIntosh capacity compared with the capacity when the plant was acquired in April 2004. The new Singapore facility is also on schedule and is expected to be fully commissioned in 2007. <br /><br />The decline in earnings for<strong> Sugars__*__ Europe</strong> has continued due to higher energy costs and__*__ as previously reported__*__ pressure on selling prices caused by an oversupply of sugar and impending changes to the EU sugar regime. This has been offset by a strong performance from Tate &amp; Lyle Sugar Trading. <br /><br />Our sugar operations in <strong>Sugars__*__ Americas and Asia</strong> continue to perform in line with our expectations. At the year end the Canadian sugar business is likely to benefit from a more substantial mark-to-market gain on raw sugar inventory than in recent years due to the prevailing world sugar price. <br /><strong><u><br />IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS</u></strong> <br /><br />As stated in the Tate &amp; Lyle announcement dated 25 November 2005 regarding the reform of the EU sugar regime__*__ “The changes to the profitability of individual operating units will give rise to a review of the carrying value of the assets concerned and is likely to result in an impairment of assets which cannot be quantified at this time.” The fixed assets and goodwill of those business units affected by the EU sugar regime are expected to total approximately £750 million at 31 March 2006__*__ before any impairment. The review is likely to result in a substantial impairment of these assets__*__ the quantification of which will be contained in the preliminary announcement of results on 25 May 2006.

Developed by Tate & Lyle’s US food ingredients team in Decatur__*__ Illinois__*__ Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 is a new Solution Set which can be used to create dual textured snacks that have a light__*__ crispy shell and are soft inside. This delicious crunchy coating can be used on fruit pieces and a variety of other products including peanuts__*__ soy nuts and sunflower kernels. Compatible with almost unlimited varieties of flavor__*__ Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 offers consumers a truly original taste experience. Spicy fire roasted strawberries__*__ chili lime soy nut__*__ coated blueberries and golden raisins will all be available for tasting at SNAXPO. 

Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 is used to formulate coated baked products and enables manufacturers to develop dual textured lower fat snacks. Moisture is removed with baking__*__ which results in a light and crunchy texture with mild sweetness. Additionally__*__ because the coating is made with SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ it has bake stable sweetness and the customer can formulate a coating that achieves a no sugar added claim. Coated Snack Create™ 700 produces exciting snacks without adding high amounts of fat or sugar sometimes associated with snacks and food on the go.

“Consumers are increasingly looking for more than just a satisfying taste – they want exciting and surprising new flavors. Manufacturers are increasingly expected to delight and tantalise the taste buds__*__” stated Doris Dougherty__*__ senior food scientist__*__ Tate & Lyle.

“Our new Solution Set makes dried fruits and raisins more interesting and appealing or soy nuts more tasty. This technology can be used to revolutionize snacks by offering fruit or soy nut choices in forms that are just fun to eat. The sky’s the limit in terms of how the coating can be flavored or textured by use of oats__*__ bran or other products. For example__*__ the spicy__*__ fire roasted strawberry is a unique__*__ unexpected combination of hot and sweet and has a crispy jacket surrounding a soft__*__ chewy fruit piece.”

Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas said__*__ “Eating on-the-go and outside of the three traditional daily meal occasions is on the rise and probably will continue as people’s lives are increasingly busy. At the same time__*__ consumers want great tasting food that they believe is more nutritious. Our research has shown that 78% of consumers want to limit fat__*__ and 72% sugar__*__ to have a healthy diet. 

“Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 addresses both of these consumer trends to bring a new dimension to snacking. We believe food manufacturers and retailers with own brands can offer consumers a different snacking experience that increases fruit intake or provides unexpected flavors with this new Tate & Lyle CREATE® solution.” 

Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 is marketed under the Tate & Lyle CREATE® services__*__ which enable manufacturers to bring innovative new products to market and rejuvenate brands through new food and beverage concepts.

","Application

Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 is easy to incorporate in a tumbler coating process__*__ and is used at a 40 – 60 percent level in a dry coating matrix and is typically combined with cereal flours or particulates before it is applied over food pieces in a tumbler.  An adhesion slurry with TATE & LYLE Stadex® dextrins__*__ Tapioca Dextrins or STAR-DRI® Corn Syrup Solids is typically sprayed over food pieces in a rotating tumbler prior to the application of the dry mix.  

 

Multiple applications of adhesion slurry and dry mix with Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 are incorporated over food pieces in the tumbler until a smooth and soft coating with target thickness is achieved.  The coated food pieces are then baked at 350 - 375 degrees Fahrenheit to achieve a crisp coating with 3 – 5 percent moisture in the finished product.  The amount and the viscosity of the adhesion slurry should be adjusted to prevent stickiness between the food pieces during the coating and baking process.  

 


Coated Snack CREATE™ 700 is one of Tate & Lyle’s many Solution Sets marketed as CORE™ service offerings__*__ which comprise:

TATE & LYLE CREATE®: innovations for the future of your product range

TATE & LYLE OPTIMIZE®: driving out costs in products and processes

399,auto,Legacy Import,6/27/2002,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle and Newham LEA science challenge,"How do you replicate everything that happens at the world’s largest cane sugar refinery in just one laboratory?

Twenty eight children - two gifted and talented year 9 scientists from each of the 14 participating schools in Newham - are taking part in the Tate & Lyle and Newham LEA Science Challenge. The pupils’ challenge is to examine the refining process at Tate & Lyle’s sugar refinery and replicate it in a university lab.

The project begins on Monday 1st July and completes with an award ceremony on Friday 5th July. Newham VIP’s such as Councillor Graham Lane__*__ Cabinet Member for Education__*__ Newham Council will be attending the awards. The Science Challenge forms part of the celebration of the Year of Science__*__ which began in the September term 2001.

The scheme has been developed to celebrate science and demonstrate the practical applications of science in the real world__*__ helping show the relevance of science by linking the school laboratory to large-scale industry. 

""Tate & Lyle are thrilled to be able to contribute to this project as part of our ongoing education programme__*__"" said Chris Fox__*__ Director of Corporate Relations__*__ ""it is important for UK industry that science is fostered and encouraged in schools today. The challenge is a unique chance for children to see the importance of science in everyday life.""

The challenge begins at the University of East London__*__ Royal Docks where pupils will have the chance to meet and take part in team activities. This will be followed by a tour of Tate & Lyle’s London refinery where they will don hard-hats and hairnets to see the refining process first hand. 

Returning to the university for the next two days pupils will have a chance to replicate the whole process in one room! The Tate & Lyle technical team will demonstrate various stages of the process in labs provided by the University of East London (UEL). Under supervision pupils then carry out each of the processes from mingling (softening the molasses coating around the raw sugar) to final crystallisation. From industrial to small scale each of the steps remains the same.

To evaluate their analyses of the project__*__ pupils have use of computers provided by UEL and are coached in presentation skills by Newham LEA staff. Finally__*__ pupils put together their presentations and displays ready for the 5th July__*__ when they will present their findings and analyses. The audience will include Professor Michael Thorne__*__ Vice Chancellor__*__ UEL__*__ Pauline Maddison__*__ Director of Education and Learning Newham LEA as well as Tate & Lyle staff. Certificates will be awarded to the students by Pauline Maddison. 

The Tate & Lyle and Newham LEA Science Challenge was originally piloted as a three-day event in July 2001 by Newham LEA and Tate & Lyle PLC.

The new recipes__*__ which will be in shops and ice cream parlours from Spring 2006__*__ have been specially created for consumers who want to reduce their calorie or fat intake__*__ while still enjoying the full flavour of traditional PreGel gelato. The extended product range will include mixes for low fat__*__ no-added sugar gelato catering for the United States__*__ Australian__*__ South American and UK market and mixes for low fat__*__ reduced-calorie gelato for the European market (UK excluded).

Ice Cream REBALANCE™ 022 comprises a mixture of SPLENDA® Sucralose - the no calorie sweetener which is made from sugar__*__ so it tastes like sugar - and other specialised Tate & Lyle ingredients that help maintain the gelato’s texture and sweetness. The Solution Set offers manufacturers process-friendly__*__ easy sugar replacement and allows for a lower calorie final product with all the taste and creaminess associated with a regular ice cream. 

Sucralose is used worldwide in over 4__*__000 food__*__ beverage and nutritional products and is the sweetening ingredient in SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener. PreGel will be using the “Sweetened with SPLENDA®“ logo for sales in the United States__*__ Mexico__*__ Australia and the United Kingdom due to good brand awareness in these countries.

""PreGel has a long history of supplying high quality gelato to a global market__*__ and it was important that we worked with an ingredients company that had a reputation for innovation__*__ as well as great product knowledge and a deep understanding of our market. Most importantly any changes to the formulation had to match the high standard of eating quality our consumers expect from PreGel. Working with Tate & Lyle has enabled us to achieve our goal of developing a range of great tasting reduced-fat__*__ reduced-sugar and no-added-sugar gelato recipes suitable for the whole family.” said Dario Rabboni__*__ Manager and Member of the Board of Directors__*__ PreGel.

“We will be promoting the fact that our new range is sweetened with SPLENDA® Sucralose by using the ""Sweetened with SPLENDA® Brand"" logo in trade and point of purchase collateral in the Americas__*__ Australia and the UK. SPLENDA® Sucralose has great brand recognition in these countries and we hope that consumers who enjoy the great taste of sucralose will love our new wellness gelato.” 

REBALANCE™ 022 is a dry mix solution set developed by Tate & Lyle specifically for PreGel. By working in partnership with PreGel’s R&D team__*__ Tate & Lyle reformulated an existing Solution Set to create a combination of ingredients suitable for use in the state-of-the art ice cream machines used in retail outlets and ice cream parlours by PreGel’s customers. 

“Tate & Lyle is keen to work alongside clients to develop tailored Solution Sets for their needs__*__” explains Rachel Moffatt__*__ Tate & Lyle’s European marketing manager. “Independent research commissioned by Tate & Lyle has shown that one in four consumers believes that reducing fat and sugar levels are the most important improvements that can be made to ice cream__*__ while 73% of current ice cream buyers would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ buy a low-fat__*__ low-sugar ice cream. REBALANCE™ 022 offers PreGel’s retailers the opportunity to sell traditional gelato in wafers and cones with a much lower calorie count. Our partnership also means that PreGel can use the well-recognised “Sweetened with SPLENDA®“ logo on their marketing and points of sale materials.”

The gelato mixes__*__ which come in chocolate__*__ cream__*__ cappuccino and raspberry flavours__*__ were piloted by PreGel at the Sigep trade fair in Rimini this January.

The interim results will be announced on 7 November 2002.

Overall trading experience to date (based upon five months’ results) has continued to be above internal expectations at the beginning of the financial year. Profits in all our major business units continue to meet or exceed plan. The results have improved with the elimination of loss-making businesses that have been sold and continuing benefits from the integration of Amylum into the Group. We expect strong first half results that will be materially above the comparative period and the prior six month period. Net debt has continued to decline with stronger operating cash flows and lower interest and tax payments.

Performance at Staley__*__ our US cereal sweetener and starch business__*__ has been strong. Manufacturing costs were lower. There was some improvement in contributions in main product lines and better returns were achieved from by-products. However ethanol selling prices and margins have been substantially lower.

At Amylum__*__ capacity utilisation for both wheat and maize has been good and operations in Eastern Europe have performed particularly well__*__ reflecting strong demand. In the West there has been some benefit from lower raw material costs and higher by-product returns.

Our sugar businesses in Europe and Canada continue to perform well and provide stable profits and strong cash flow.

The reduction in net debt and interest rates together with some benefit from interest on tax repayments has resulted in a substantial reduction in the interest charge and improvement in interest cover.

We anticipate that the results for the full year will revert to a traditional trading pattern with a significant weighting of profits towards the first half. Increased selling prices in next calendar year’s sweetener pricing round__*__ including the recovery of prevailing higher corn costs at Staley__*__ will be the significant factor in determining the likelihood of an improvement in Group profits in the second half by comparison with the same period in the previous year.

The practical visits will encompass many subject areas including risk assessment__*__ health and safety__*__ microbiology__*__ quality control__*__ energy production and quantitative analysis. 

The course is much more vocational than the traditional GCSE__*__ and consists of coursework modules totalling 66.6% with only 33.3% as a written exam. From their visits to the Tate & Lyle refinery__*__ students will learn how to identify and prevent potential biological__*__ physical and chemical hazards__*__ fire safety and first aid procedures. Pupils will also experience how to carry out health and safety checks throughout the workplace. A key requirement of the syllabus is that students demonstrate competency in the disciplines of measuring__*__ procedure and other quantitative analysis in industrial and scientific workplaces. 

Students will also learn about working with energy. From processes used at the refinery__*__ students will learn how electricity is generated and how to capture and recycle waste energy. 

'By taking the classroom into modern industry - students can experience science at work__*__' said Rob Jones__*__ 'the syllabus directly relates science to its practical applications and demonstrates its relevance to the modern world. This is particularly important in an area such as East London. Tate and Lyle have provided a springboard of opportunity in an underrepresented subject for local pupils.'

412,auto,Legacy Import,2/14/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC – Sucralose update,"Tate & Lyle has become aware of the re-appearance of a low-calorie tabletop sweetener product branded as 'Altern' in a small number of Wal*Mart stores in the US. Altern is described as containing sucralose. Tate & Lyle has analysed samples of this product and believes it to contain an active ingredient of Chinese origin. Work is being carried out to determine if this ingredient meets the stringent US Food and Drug Administration specifications and / or infringes on Tate & Lyle’s intellectual property.

The expanded Alabama facility is expected to commence commissioning in April__*__ as planned__*__ thereby doubling the capacity acquired in April 2004. <br /><br /><u>SALES PRICING ROUNDS</u> <br /><br />The overall net result of the annual sales contract pricing rounds is that we have achieved our objective of recovering next year's higher energy costs. The effect on the three businesses is detailed below. <br /><br />The European market for sugar and related products has__*__ as stated in both our interim results announcement and the 25 November 2005 announcement regarding reform of the sugar regime__*__ been affected by an oversupply of sugar. As expected__*__ the calendar 2006 sweetener pricing round in the markets where <b>Ingredients__*__ </b><b>Europe</b> competes with sugar has been challenging. The markets for value added food ingredients and industrial starches have been more robust. After higher energy costs we expect in local currency terms total net margins for Ingredients__*__ Europe to be below those achieved in calendar 2005. <br /><br />The anticipated oversupply of sugar in Europe has also affected our European cane refineries and our sugar beet operations in East and Central Europe. The market pressure that we previously highlighted has intensified in the last few months and this is expected to lead to a modest decline in earnings for <b>Sugars__*__ </b><b>Europe</b><b> </b>in the balance of this financial year and a further decline in the year to March 2007. <br /><br /><b>Ingredients__*__ Americas </b>has substantially completed the negotiation of its calendar 2006 sweetener sales contracts. These contracts__*__ as in previous years__*__ are a mix of toll business (where Ingredients__*__ Americas receives a fixed processing margin) and conventional supply contracts (where Ingredients Americas accepts risk on the price of corn__*__ which it covers on the futures market).

422,auto,Legacy Import,1/13/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle announces the proposal to close its plant in Thessaloniki__*__ Greece by September 2008,"Tate & Lyle announces today a proposal to close its corn wet milling plant in Thessaloniki__*__ Greece by September 2008. The proposal to close this plant has been communicated to the Tate & Lyle European Works Council__*__ Local Works Council and employees__*__ and will be the subject of consultations over the coming weeks. On closure__*__ Tate & Lyle would continue to service its customers in the Greek market from its other plants in the EU.

This proposed closure is due to the reform of the EU Sugar Regime__*__ which regulates the production and prices of sugar and isoglucose. The new Sugar Regime comes into effect in July 2006 with the target of significantly reducing sugar production quotas and cutting the sugar reference price by 36%. This will directly reduce the profitability of isoglucose and other grades of glucose produced in Thessaloniki. Unlike sugar processors__*__ who see an almost corresponding percentage reduction in the price that they pay for sugar beet__*__ there will be no reduction in the price of maize for the production of isoglucose. As a result__*__ the Thessaloniki plant would be driven into a loss making position.

Clive Rutherford__*__ Chief Executive of Tate & Lyle Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe said “It is with regret that we announce this proposal. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years__*__ it has not proved sufficient to offset the inherent cost structure of the plant__*__ which arises from the high cost of local maize and the plant’s small scale (necessitated by the restricted local market). These factors make the plant highly vulnerable to the consequences of the EU reform and whilst the plant may be able partially to absorb the negative impact of the reform during the early period of the new Regime__*__ possibly up to September 2008__*__ after that time we expect that the plant would no longer be viable under the Regime”.

423,auto,Legacy Import,1/12/2006,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle launches two new Meripro proteins,"Tate & Lyle__*__ a global leader in renewable ingredients__*__ is to launch two new wheat protein isolates - <strong>MERIPRO 410</strong> and <strong>MERIPRO 420</strong>. Used across a broad range of food products Meripro 410 brings functional benefits as an emulsifier and dough plasticizer__*__ while Meripro 420 has unique emulsifying and foaming properties well-suited for desserts and confectionery. These ingredients__*__ which will be available globally__*__ are the first in a new range of wheat proteins developed using a new patent-protected form of wheat protein processing based on physical extraction from vital wheat gluten.

Meripro 410 and 420 can be used as alternative to animal derived ingredients (such as egg__*__ milk and gelatine) and are suitable for consumers following vegetarian or halal diets and are certified kosher (parev). All products in the Meripro range are GM-Free and do not require an E-number declaration.

<strong>MERIPRO 410</strong> can be used as an emulsifier across a broad food pH-range__*__ making it suitable for use in products as varied as sauces and dressings and non-dairy whipped ‘cream’ toppings. Its high emulsifying capacity and emulsion texturizing power mean that manufacturers can create very stable emulsions at low-usage requirement.

Meripro 410 can help food manufacturers produce egg-yolk-free__*__ hence cholesterol-free salad dressings. It can also be used to create 100 per cent non-dairy whipped ‘cream’ without caseinates__*__ helping reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices.

Used in non-dairy ‘cream’ applications it provides good whipability and firmness__*__ while stabilising the foam during storage. This means that it can create products that are cost-efficient and also suitable for consumers who wish to avoid dairy products__*__ with Asia being a key market. 

In addition to its great functionality as an emulsifier__*__ Meripro 410 is an excellent dough plasticizer ideal for use in bakery__*__ convenience food__*__ pizza and snack food applications. One of Meripro 410’s strengths is that it can modify dough rheology without affecting the gluten network: incorporating Meripro 410 into a dough recipe softens the dough without inducing stickiness__*__ allowing improved sheeting in products such as pizza dough and laminated products__*__ while maintaining dough strength throughout the freeze-thaw process.

It can also bind four to five times its own weight in oil__*__ making it ideal for food-service bakery and snacks. Using Meripro 410 can extend a food-service product’s shelf life and make food appear more attractive by preventing oil-leakage onto packaging. Again 410 can be used to offer cleaner ingredient declarations: made from wheat__*__ it is a perfect match to bakery products__*__ as opposed to other reducing agents like cysteine. 

<strong>MERIPRO 420</strong> can be used to emulsify__*__ deliver mouthfeel__*__ whipability or chewiness in whipped desserts__*__ milk-shakes__*__ egg-white-free mousses and gelatine-free aerated (chewy) confectionery.

Meripro 420 has already proved effective in the manufacture of chewy fruit flavoured confectionery__*__ launched at Food Ingredients Europe in November. Replacing gelatine in confectionery not only ‘cleans up’ the ingredient declaration and takes out costs__*__ with Meripro 420 it also simplifies the production process due to the protein’s heat stability and the fact that it can be added as a powder prior to cooking. Its visco-elasticity prevents breakage and gives chew to the final product. The protein also emulsifies the coconut fat in the recipe to provide stability and firmness. Tate & Lyle hold the application patent for use in fruit-flavoured candies.

“These new wheat protein isolates are extremely flexible__*__ functional ingredients__*__” explains Caroline Sanders__*__ Product Manager__*__ of Tate & Lyle. “They combine top performance with cost-effectiveness. They will help food manufacturers achieve a wide variety of goals__*__ from providing true non-dairy products to offering 100 per cent vegetarian confectionery that can reach a wider customer base.” 

Sanders adds__*__ “Tate & Lyle’s European food and industrial ingredients division has a long history of innovation in wheat proteins__*__ we were the first to pioneer the use of wheat proteins as functional food ingredient. This heritage is very much alive today and has led to the invention of the patent-protected manufacturing process that has helped us develop the Meripro 400 range. We are proud of the research that has gone into the development of this product line – this is a real technological advance and is unique to Tate & Lyle.”

425,auto,Legacy Import,12/16/2005,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle study finds consumers becoming increasingly educated about food and are questioning the health profile of their favourite brands,"Consumers have become more concerned about healthy eating over the past two years and are more aware of__*__ and educated about__*__ the issues relating to a healthy diet__*__ according to research from Tate & Lyle__*__ a global leader in renewable ingredients. This increase in awareness has been fuelled by government campaigns and media debates__*__ such as Jamie Oliver’s crusade to improve school dinners. The debate about children’s diet has been key__*__ with steps taken in both Britain and France to control the types of food available in schools. 

Tate & Lyle__*__ one of the world’s largest food ingredient companies__*__ has been commissioning bespoke consumer insight research programmes for the past two years in Western Europe__*__ monitoring attitudes towards diet__*__ health and food issues. The research is a mix of qualitative research discussions and quantitative polling data obtained from representative samples of shoppers in Britain__*__ France and Germany. 

The increase in concern about and awareness of health issues has caused consumers to question the nutritional value of food they buy and consume on a regular basis and to become sceptical about brand claims. When asked__*__ 65% of consumers agreed with the statement ‘often brands that claim to be healthy aren’t healthy at all’. 

Key findings from the study include: 

<ul><li>Consumers are looking for ways to improve their diet__*__ with 66% of respondents across Europe agreeing that ‘I am always looking for ways to eat more healthily’ (70% UK__*__ 74% France and 56% Germany). </li></ul><ul><li>More than eight in ten consumers (84%) know that eating fruit and vegetables is key to a healthy diet. 92% of British consumers believe in the importance of fresh fruit compared with German consumers (89%) and French consumers (70%).</li></ul><ul><li>Fat and sugar are the top two elements that consumers believe they should limit to make their diets more healthy and are the most frequently requested ingredients to be reduced in a wide variety of foods. Eight in ten people (82%) believe that fat ‘needs to be limited to have a healthy diet’ and 75% of people felt the same way about sugar.</li></ul><ul><li>One in two adults (51%) say that they are solely responsible for what they eat. When consumers were asked what other influences there are on their diet__*__ popular choices included: family and friends (46%)__*__ brands and advertising (28%)__*__ the media (17%)__*__ retailers (14%).*</li></ul><ul><li>Only 27% of parents believe they solely influence what their children eat. Family and friends (68%)__*__ brands and advertising (30%)__*__ schools (30%)__*__ government (17%) were popular choices as additional influences.*</li></ul><ul><li>Parents are concerned about brands that target their children with 74% believing ‘food and drinks marketed at kids are often unhealthy’. </li></ul><ul><li>Cutting back on alcohol is seen as important for a healthy diet by 47% of Europeans__*__ but there are big differences between France (22%) and Germany (68%).</li></ul>*Selected from a detailed list of potential influencing factors. The list of factors was generated based on our understanding from the qualitative research discussions. Tate & Lyle’s qualitative studies show that there are some differences between the British__*__ French and German attitudes towards food. Balance and moderation are central to French and German eating__*__ whereas in the UK whilst a balanced diet is seen as a good idea__*__ it is not the reality of everyday eating. Consequently__*__ there is a more negative attitude towards food in the UK__*__ where some foods are labelled ‘bad’ and others ‘good’. 

Across Europe__*__ while consumers are becoming more concerned about the health consequences of their diet__*__ the majority of people still believe that taste is the most important factor in determining what they eat. More than two in five consumers (42%) agreed that enjoying food is more important than nutrition__*__ while one in three people (33%) argue that taste and health are equally important. The remaining 25 % of respondents were ambiguous__*__ not agreeing with any stated view.

Visited by the Mayor of Greenwich Cllr. Don Austin and John Furlonger from the Chamber of Commerce - 200 children at the Millennium School (John Harrison Way) took part in TACS__*__ ‘Truck and Child Safety’ demonstration on March 12. 



Trucks and tankers were driven up to the school itself to show the children the full scale of the vehicles. 



The children took part in TACS in their individual classes. The children learned by carrying out various tasks - establishing the distance they need to stand in front of the vehicle to be seen by the driver__*__ where the blind spots are around the vehicle__*__ and the relative size and noise of the truck in comparison with other road vehicles. A demonstration involving bicycles was also used to show the importance of taking care as a cyclist behind large-scale vehicles. 



Starting with the Millennium School__*__ it is intended that all Primary Schools in the borough will be able to benefit from this scheme. Organised by Exel__*__ the global leader in supply chain logistics__*__ and supported by Amylum UK (part of the Tate & Lyle Group) the scheme is designed to improve child road safety and awareness__*__ particularly in busy urban areas.



'We hope that the scale and originality of this scheme impresses upon children the need to be seen to be safe__*__' said Bob Hough__*__ Site Manager Amylum UK. 'It’s a good lesson to learn for all types of road traffic.'



'We are delighted to be working in partnership with Amylum to deliver this important message to children. The work being undertaken in Greenwich is part of a nationwide programme designed by Exel to heighten the awareness of the dangers of large vehicles__*__' said Neil Ripley__*__ Managing Director of Exel’s Special Products business.

<strong>Highlights of trading for 11 months to February 2003 </strong>

Since the update on 30 January 2003 Tate & Lyle’s trading has remained in line with our expectations.

Trading in Amylum has outperformed the corresponding period in the prior year. Benefits have come from the earlier than expected achievement of savings resulting from integration into the Group and a strong performance from its operations in Central Europe. Staley has continued to perform well growing profits from food ingredients although citric acid has suffered lower earnings as a result of the competitive market. The European Union and Canadian sugar activities have continued to perform satisfactorily__*__ however the central European sugar businesses have been affected by changes to the Czech Republic sugar regulations. Rising energy costs in the second half-year had little impact overall in the current year due to our hedging policy.

The cash flow from operations__*__ together with disposal proceeds__*__ has further reduced net debt in the second half of the year.

This has deepened Tate & Lyle's involvement with the school through the Volunteer Assisted Reading Programme (VARP) - organised by the Newham Education Business Partnership (NEBP). As part of the scheme__*__ employee volunteers have been spending at least one morning session per week with young pupils ages 6 to 10. 

The reading scheme was designed to help those pupils who need an extra push with their reading or a boost to their self-esteem. The programme has been a great success and the £500 donation should ensure the kids don't run out of reading matter!

Headteacher Caryn Metzger said of the scheme__*__ 'With the demands of the Primary curriculum there is far less time to hear individual children read and this scheme provides a fantastic opportunity for some one-to-one support.'

'It’s a great experience to see the children gain confidence in their abilities as the weeks go by' said Peter Steele__*__ Facilities Manager (Tate & Lyle) and a reading-volunteer. 'You gain an enormous sense of pride through their achievements.'

The scheme was pioneered by Tate & Lyle and the NEBP in 1999 at Tollgate School. Today__*__ 44 schools in the Borough participate in the programme. VARP has about a hundred volunteers every term - including employees from local businesses__*__ students from Newham Sixth Form College and other community volunteers.

Trading since the update issued on 28 July 2004__*__ prior to the Annual General Meeting__*__ has continued to go well. Over the five months to August 2004__*__ profit before tax and exceptional items has exceeded both our budgetary expectations and the corresponding period of the prior year.



SPLENDA® Sucralose has seen exceptional growth. This partially reflects initial uptake by customers to fill the pipeline for new product launches and has been achieved through increased production (as we improve efficiency and implement the first of the capacity expansions announced earlier this year)__*__ and a drawdown against inventory. One-off costs of integrating the business have been lower than our original estimate.



The sharp increase in wheat and corn raw material prices in the second half of the March 2004 financial year has__*__ as anticipated__*__ caused profits at Amylum in the five months to be below those in the corresponding period. These cereal prices have subsequently declined close to the level before last years price increase. Good growth has been experienced in value added food ingredients.



Staley in the US has__*__ as we predicted__*__ experienced reduced sweetener volumes; these have been offset by good growth in food ingredients and industrial starches. Ethanol has also performed strongly. The citric acid product line traded profitably (a small loss was incurred in the corresponding period). The astaxanthin plant to produce AquastaTM (an essential nutrient and pigment for farm raised fish) in the UK has started production.



Our sugar operations in the UK__*__ Portugal and Canada all performed at or above plan levels. There has not been any new information or clarification on the proposal for reform of the EU sugar regime which was tabled by the European Commission in July.

Profit before tax and exceptional items for the quarter ended 30th June 2004 has been ahead of both our expectation and the corresponding period in the prior year. All major businesses have met or exceeded plan. Compared with the corresponding period__*__ the anticipated shortfall in Amylum's profitability has been more than offset by a better than expected contribution achieved by SPLENDA® Sucralose. Although it is early in the financial year the decline in raw material prices for Amylum and the success of SPLENDA® Sucralose makes it likely that the profit before tax and exceptional items for the year will be somewhat higher than the Board envisaged at the time of the preliminary announcement of results on 3rd June 2004. <br /><br />We announced earlier today that Staley has reached agreement to end the long running high fructose corn syrup civil legal case in the US with the payment of total damages of US$100 million (£55 million). This will result in an exceptional charge to the profit and loss account of this amount. As the payment is expected to be tax deductible in the US__*__ this equates to a charge of $60 million (£33 million) on an after tax basis. Staley continues to deny emphatically involvement in any wrongdoing__*__ but has settled with great reluctance to ensure an end to this lengthy action and to avoid the risk and uncertainty that a US jury trial would involve. The buyer of Western Sugar has refinanced and has accelerated repayment of our outstanding loan note which arose on disposal of Western in May 2002. This has resulted in cash proceeds to Tate &amp; Lyle of £22 million and an exceptional credit to the profit and loss account of £16 million. <br /><br />We are pleased with the progress being made on our strategy to grow value added products and__*__ in particular__*__ the success of SPLENDA® Sucralose. We announced earlier this year an expansion to the plant in McIntosh__*__ Alabama and today announce a further investment of £24 million (US$45 million). The investment will be funded from existing resources and will be completed by April 2006 by which time the output from the Alabama site will be more than double its level at the time of the realignment of the SPLENDA® Sucralose partnership. <br /><br />The commissioning of the astaxanthin plant to produce Aquasta™__*__ a natural nutrient and pigment for farm raised fish__*__ has also been completed and commercial sales have commenced. Construction of the new plant for the DuPont Tate &amp; Lyle BioProducts__*__ LLC joint venture to produce Bio-3G in Loudon__*__ Tennessee__*__ has commenced.

What now follows will be wide-ranging discussions involving the industry__*__ farmers__*__ customers and national governments as well as the European institutions.

We are encouraged by recent support from the Environment__*__ Food &amp; Rural Affairs Select Committee investigating the issue which stated that: “We agree with the Government that ways have to be found to ensure the cane refining sector is not put at an unfair disadvantage during an interim period when preferential suppliers are adapting to the reform.” The timetable for negotiations extends into 2005. <br /><br />Tate &amp; Lyle is a world leader in ingredients.

Damages claimed in the case amounted to $1.4 billion__*__ subject to automatic tripling and the addition of attorneys’ fees. Under US civil anti-trust laws__*__ defendants in trials of this type are jointly and severally liable for any damages awarded to the plaintiff. 

The case was filed with the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois in Peoria in July 1995__*__ but dismissed by that Court in August 2001. That dismissal was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in June 2002. The case was proceeding to a full jury trial in early September 2004. On 15th March 2004__*__ the District Court approved Cargill’s (and American Maize Product Company’s) settlement with the Plaintiffs in the amount of $24 million. On 17th June 2004__*__ ADM announced that it had agreed to settle for $400 million. The settlement announced today brings the action to a complete end. 

Robert Gibber__*__ Tate & Lyle PLC General Counsel__*__ commented:

“In 1995__*__ a Grand Jury reviewed millions of pages of evidence yet brought no charges against any manufacturer of HFCS. However__*__ as is typical in the US__*__ this was followed by a civil class action alleging violations of federal anti-trust laws. 

<br/>

“We deny emphatically involvement in any wrongdoing and believe we were in a position to demonstrate this at trial. However__*__ particularly in light of the recent settlements by the other defendants__*__ a jury trial would have exposed Staley to a degree of risk__*__ itself magnified by automatic tripling of damages and the addition of attorneys’ fees__*__ which could not be justified. For this reason we reluctantly decided to settle on the best terms available from the plaintiffs as announced today. This agreement does not involve any admission of liability but does remove the uncertainties hanging over Staley from these proceedings.”

480,auto,Legacy Import,9/24/2003,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC – Trading Update,"In line with its regular practice__*__ Tate & Lyle issues the following trading update prior to meeting with stockbrokers’ analysts and entering its closed period for interim results to 30 September 2003. The interim results will be announced on 6 November 2003.

Based upon the results for the five months to August 2003__*__ profit before tax and exceptional items has been in line with internal expectations we set at the beginning of the financial year. Our major business units have all traded at or around plan levels.

Results from the citric acid production line have improved following the acceleration of the closure of the Mexican plant in July 2003 and a small increase in spot selling prices. Trading in the last three months has been at the break-even level.

The actuarial review of the UK pension fund at 31 March 2003 has not yet been finalised but it is anticipated that there will be a small deficit which will result in a modest additional charge to profit.

The dry weather in Europe has resulted in both wheat and maize price increases in Europe the effect of which we intend to mitigate with selling price increases in the second half.

The first half last year benefited from strong trading and unusual interest income. As indicated in the announcement of the results for the year to March 2003__*__ we expect a more even split of profits in the current financial year with the first half weaker and the second half stronger than in the previous year.

At Staley in the US__*__ whilst some of the 2004 sweetener sales contracts have been completed at increased prices__*__ the negotiation of major contracts is ongoing and may take some weeks to conclude. These contracts__*__ which are being negotiated against a background of recent corn price rises__*__ will influence the final outcome on sweetener product margins. Gains in citric acid selling prices have seen this product line return to profit. 

Negotiation of Amylum’s annual contracts is not yet finished. Raw material costs in Europe__*__ which had increased markedly at the time of our interim announcement on the 6 November 2003__*__ have continued to rise significantly. These have reduced margins on Amylum’s contracts agreed at that time and subsequent pricing has not fully recovered higher net raw material costs. This has been exacerbated by recently increased competitive pressures and by weaker vital wheat gluten prices so that results from Amylum for 2004 will be below our earlier expectations. 

Profit before tax and exceptional items for the Group for the financial year to 31 March 2004 will depend upon the final outcome of the pricing negotiations in both the US and Europe and the translation impact of exchange rates. Nevertheless__*__ we anticipate results will be close to market expectations with a weaker Amylum result in the final quarter being offset by a satisfactory performance in the rest of the business. 

Looking forward__*__ based on our current experience of raw material costs and contract negotiations to date__*__ we expect Amylum’s results for the financial year to 31 March 2005 to be significantly below those of 2004. A review of Amylum’s operations is in hand in order further to reduce the cost base. Although we anticipate further progress in 2005 at our North American businesses__*__ this is likely to be offset on currency translation.

509,auto,Legacy Import,5/26/2004,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle and DuPont form renewable resources joint venture,"Tate & Lyle PLC and DuPont today announced a new U.S. joint venture to make an industrial ingredient from renewable sources__*__ such as corn (maize)__*__ which will replace petrochemicals__*__ for use in the manufacture of clothing__*__ plastics and textile fibres. The formation of this joint venture marks the next milestone of the agreement first announced on 1 August 2000. 





The new company – DuPont Tate & Lyle BioProducts__*__ LLC – is equally owned by Tate & Lyle and DuPont and will be based in Wilmington__*__ Delaware. The company plans to construct its initial commercial manufacturing facility in Loudon__*__ Tennessee__*__ adjacent to an existing Tate & Lyle facility. Construction is scheduled to be completed by 31 March 2006. 



The joint venture will use a proprietary fermentation and purification process developed jointly by DuPont and Tate & Lyle to produce 1__*__3 propanediol (PDO)__*__ the key building block for DuPont™ Sorona®. A pilot facility has been operating at Tate & Lyle’s Decatur__*__ Illinois facility for several years. As DuPont’s newest polymer platform__*__ Sorona® offers unique properties such as stain-resistance__*__ exceptional softness__*__ comfort stretch and recovery__*__ and UV- and chlorine-resistance when compared to polyester and nylon. Sorona® can be used in a variety of applications including textile apparel__*__ interiors__*__ engineering resins and packaging. The new bio-based technology uses less energy and employs renewable resources – replacing the need for traditional petrochemicals now used to produce 1__*__3 propanediol (PDO).



“The joint venture is further evidence of Tate & Lyle’s strength in innovation__*__ our success in developing key industrial partnerships and our ability to generate value added product growth. It is a natural fit with our core skills in fermentation of natural products__*__” said Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive__*__ Tate & Lyle PLC.



“Partnerships are an important component of our strategy to build our business and we are delighted that our relationship with DuPont continues to advance. This is also a good example of the excellence of Tate & Lyle’s research and development capability__*__ in delivering a product from renewable resources that can selectively replace those made from petrochemicals.” 



“As a science company__*__ DuPont is committed to business and research initiatives that meet customer and market needs while delivering both shareholder and societal value__*__” said John Ranieri__*__ Vice President and General Manager – DuPont Bio-Based Materials. “Sorona® is an excellent example of putting science to work by integrating biology with materials science. Sorona® combines the emerging discipline of metabolic engineering (the capability for biology to produce valuable products) with the leading polymer engineering capabilities of DuPont.” 



Sorona® is currently manufactured from petroleum-based PDO__*__ and is available commercially from DuPont. It is used to produce clothing and fabrics with superior softness__*__ dyeability__*__ and a natural stretch. Bio-PDO™ corn derived chemical and Sorona® polymer made from Bio-PDO™ will be available in 2006.

Being the best – YOU CAN was announced during a “thank-you” celebration for NEBP’s business partners. “We have already discovered some amazing success stories__*__ such as Olympic silver medalist and coach Clarence Callendar__*__ actor and producer Tendeyi Jemberi (TJ) and designer Alexander McQueen.

NEBP is asking schools and businesses to point out past students and colleagues from Newham who are career role models in order to communicate their success to Newham students and add them to its Gallery of Success. 

NEBP will send information on role models to schools which may be unaware of the achievements of their past students__*__ and will use the case studies in its successful 'BOSS' programme__*__ which is run in every secondary school in Newham.

556,auto,Legacy Import,5/9/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle: Update on the Disposal of European Starch Operations,"Tate &amp; Lyle announces that it is at an advanced stage of exclusive discussions with Syral SAS (a subsidiary of Tereos of France) which may lead to the disposal of its interest in certain of the facilities of its Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe division (&ldquo;TALFIIE&rdquo;)__*__ and that it has today begun the consultation process with the European and local works councils and other employee representatives. <br />
<br />
Tate &amp; Lyle announced on 25 October 2006 that it was exploring the possibility of the full or partial disposal of TALFIIE. The TALFIIE operations that are subject to the ongoing discussions (&ldquo;the Target Businesses&rdquo;) announced today are those in the UK__*__ Belgium__*__ France__*__ Spain and Italy. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s operations in Koog__*__ The Netherlands (the main site in Western Europe for corn-based value added starch production)__*__ Morocco and the Eaststarch joint venture (which has operations in Hungary__*__ Slovakia__*__ Bulgaria__*__ Romania and Turkey) are excluded from these discussions. <br />
<br />
Tate &amp; Lyle will continue to develop its value added ingredients business in Europe through these businesses together with its Global Food Ingredients Group__*__ which includes Cesalpinia Foods__*__ and (upon completion) G.C. Hahn__*__ and will continue to seek to supplement its value added business through the acquisition of further bolt-on ingredient companies. TALFIIE&rsquo;s Belgian entity includes the head office__*__ shared service centre and single billing entity in Aalst__*__ Belgium (&ldquo;SSC&rdquo;). The SSC is excluded from the sale discussions and consultations are now underway regarding how__*__ if the disposal of the Target Businesses goes ahead__*__ the functions currently performed in the SSC will be restructured to reflect the requirements of Syral and of Tate &amp; Lyle for their respective retained operations in Europe. Following consultation with employee representatives__*__ any transaction would be subject to antitrust approval in Europe. The earliest anticipated date for completion is therefore the end of summer 2007. <strong><br />
<br />
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION</strong> The gross cash consideration for the Target Businesses before restructuring costs is expected to be in the range of &pound;200 million to &pound;220 million. Based on un-audited pro forma figures for the year 31 March 2007__*__ the proportions of TALFIIE operating profits and net operating assets attributable to the Target Businesses were both approximately 50%. On the assumption that an agreement in the terms currently contemplated is entered into__*__ the Board is now actively considering the utilisation of the proceeds as part of a return of capital to shareholders and expects to be in a position to update shareholders in this regard at the AGM on 18 July 2007. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.<br />

559,auto,Legacy Import,5/10/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Cacolac launches new product line extension__*__ Cacolac Infini__*__ following Tate & Lyle reformulation,"French dairy specialist Cacolac has developed a new energy reduced version of its iconic cocoa drink__*__ following a reformulation by Tate &amp; Lyle. Launched in 1954__*__ the brand Cacolac is a household name in France. Cacolac Infini__*__ which is fat free and has no added sugars__*__ is the first reformulation since 1993. The cocoa drink__*__ which is primarily marketed towards women__*__ also contains added fibre. <br />
<br />
Cacolac first approached Tate &amp; Lyle with the intention of developing a reduced sugar version of its chocolate flavoured beverage sweetened with SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose. After discussions with Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s research and development team__*__ it became apparent that Cacolac could benefit from increased consumer interest in fibre and other health propositions. <br />
<br />
In addition to reformulation work__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle also offered guidance on labelling regulations and on-packaging health claims. In order to meet the claims suggested by Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s regulatory team__*__ the new cocoa drink has been specially formulated to meet the following product claims: <br />
&bull;""Reduced sugars&rdquo; <br />
&bull;&ldquo;Energy reduced&rdquo; <br />
&bull;&ldquo;With no added sugars&rdquo; <br />
&bull;&ldquo;Source of fibre&rdquo; <br />
&bull;&ldquo;Fat-free&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Richard VESSAIRE__*__ Directeur Commercial at Cacolac__*__ said__*__ &ldquo;Given the affection people have for the Cacolac brand in France__*__ it was crucial that any changes to the formulation did not come at the expense of taste. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s R&amp;D experts developed a bespoke ingredient system to achieve a new nutrition profile while maintaining the great taste that has made Cacolac one of the most popular cocoa drinks in France.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Mike Augustine__*__ Global Vice President__*__ Food Ingredient Applications and Technical Service at Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ said__*__ &rdquo;We were delighted to have the opportunity to work with such an established brand as Cacolac. Clearly meeting the taste expectations of the original beverage was vital. The development work we have undertaken with Cacolac is a good example of the range of services we can offer our customers__*__ including consumer research__*__ ingredient blending and assistance on nutrition labelling.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
The new cocoa drink will initially be available in selected supermarkets and &ldquo;hypermarch&eacute;s&rdquo; in France__*__ the national launch is planned to follow later this year. The customised ingredient blend is based on Milk Drink REBALANCE&trade; and includes SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose__*__ stabilisers from Cesalpinia Foods__*__ and added fibre. <br />

562,auto,Legacy Import,5/16/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle showcases two new REBALANCE™ ingredient systems at the “World of Private Label” exhibition in Amsterdam (22-23 May) - stand number 7860,"<p>Tate &amp; Lyle continues to expand its REBALANCE&trade; range with new ingredient systems for reduced-sugars or no-added-sugars desserts and sauces__*__ and will be showcasing<strong> </strong>these at the &ldquo;World of Private Label&rdquo; exhibition in Amsterdam__*__ 22-23 May. Private or &lsquo;own label&rsquo; is growing market share across Europe - particularly in the UK.</p>
<p>Lucy Beverley__*__ Assistant Marketing Manager__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle said__*__ &ldquo;Consumer interest in health and wellness is shaping the food industry and driving new product formulation. Consumers expect increased choice and lighter options__*__ and that extends not only to the big brands but to private or own label products. In response to this__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle has increasingly been working with own-label manufacturers and the food service sector to develop__*__ reformulate and enrich their products without impacting on taste and mouthfeel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to the demand for lighter products__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s European research team has developed two new sweetening and texturizing systems for low-fat aerated dairy desserts. Perfect for low-fat chocolate mousse__*__ Dairy Dessert REBALANCE&trade; systems are available for reduced-sugars and no-added-sugars formulations &ndash; reducing sugars by 52 per cent and 73 per cent respectively*. </p>
<p>By using SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose and a specialised blend of Tate &amp; Lyle ingredients__*__ Dairy Dessert REBALANCE&trade; can be used with Belgian chocolate to make a deliciously indulgent chocolate mousse with an impressive calorie reduction of just over 40 per cent. The reduced sugar formulation is also high in dietary fibres and contains a combination of prebiotic soluble fibres. Research conducted by Tate &amp; Lyle has shown that 35% of consumers in the UK__*__ France and Germany want reduced-calorie chilled desserts. 33% want reduced-sugar chilled desserts &ndash; rising to 47% for dairy desserts consumed by children.</p>
<p>Caroline Sanders__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s European Solution Systems Product Manager said. &ldquo;Last year we launched Dairy Dessert REBALANCE&trade; formulations for spoonable and set products like custards and flans__*__ so developing a luxurious but light chocolate mousse was a natural next step. By using Tate &amp; Lyle Cesalpinia&rsquo;s FRIMULSION texturant and emulsifier in the final recipes we&rsquo;ve been able to make substantial calorie savings but keep the indulgent__*__ creamy mouthfeel consumers expect from a treat.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Customers in the savoury foods convenience sector are also looking to offer reduced sugars and reduced calorie products. Responding to this demand__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle has extended its original Sauce REBALANCE&trade; line with a sweetening__*__ texturising and bulking system for sweet and sour sauce. This new Sauce REBALANCE&trade; system provides the gloss__*__ shine__*__ flavour and texture that consumers expect from sweet and sour sauce but__*__ in addition__*__ reduces the calorie content by over 60% compared with a standard full sugar recipe. By combining a select range of Tate &amp; Lyle ingredients with SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose__*__ sauces made with this ingredient system are acid__*__ heat and shear stable and have optimal product shelf life.<br />

<p>Almost a year ago the children had been left down in the dumps when their wooden frame was condemned for safety reasons.</p>
<p>So important was the equipment to the School in Burke Street__*__ that Headteacher Ann organised a mammoth fund-raising effort which would see the frame replaced with a new colourful creation in just eight months.</p>
<p>Among those the school encouraged to step in and contribute to the Climbing Frame Appeal was Tate &amp; Lyle. The Company made a significant donation towards the cause to get the new frame on a firm footing.</p>
<p>Other sponsors included local businesses and traders from nearby Rathbone Street market__*__ London Power Washers__*__ the Newham Christian Fellowship Snack Bar Association__*__ Community Governor__*__ Sally Craig__*__ who took part in last October&rsquo;s Great North Run and used the occasion to raise funds for the Appeal__*__ plus the children themselves. They turned young Olympians for the day when they took part in a five lap fun run around a nearby football pitch last November.</p>
<p>The special celebration on Friday not only gave the School a chance to mark the opening of its new climbing frame but to thank those who had helped with the Appeal by presenting them with a thank you card from pupils and staff.</p>
<p>With an army of eager youngsters on hand__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s Ken Wilson and Oasis Nursery Headteacher__*__ Ann Buckingham__*__ officially declared the frame &lsquo;open for business&rsquo; in front of an audience of invited parents__*__ pupils__*__ staff__*__ governors and sponsors.</p>
<p>Commenting on Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s donation__*__ Ken said: &ldquo;The Oasis Nursery has such a fantastic reputation not only in the local community but also with Ofsted. Tate &amp; Lyle has been committed to promoting health and wellbeing in the community for a long time and when approached for a donation we were delighted to be able to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With school lessons abandoned for the day__*__ the playground was turned into an amusement park__*__ complete with bouncy castle__*__ face painting__*__ football activities__*__ a bubble machine__*__ disco__*__ food stall and tombola. Even Trevor Markham__*__ the owner of Park Leisure Ltd in Kent whose company supplied and fitted the climbing frame came along with a balloon machine for the children.</p>
<p>Police officers from the Canning Town South Safer Neighbourhood Team set up a stall inside the school handing out goodies and going walkabout in a giant costume to promote the work of their team safety to parents and teachers. Other stallholders included EarlyStart and the Canning Town and Custom Regeneration Project Team.</p>
<p>Thanking all those involved in the day and the Appeal__*__ Headteacher Ann said: &ldquo;This has been a fantastic day. The children love this frame and have been like bees around a honey pot since they were able to use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a new climbing frame for the children was very important. We place a high priority on providing opportunities for our children to take part in physical exercise every day because we know that this will help them to become happy and healthy and all the more ready for learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old frame has been out of action for a long time and the children have really missed it. We are very grateful to everyone that has helped with our Appeal. Without them this would not have been possible.&rdquo;</p>

577,auto,Legacy Import,6/7/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Taking fibre from the fields to the table – Tate & Lyle’s new range of ‘PROMITOR™' branded fibres will add essential fibre with no impact on taste,"<p><em>New ingredients will also support ENRICH™ service bakery__*__ beverage and dairy prototypes</em>
</p><p><em></em>
</p><p>Tate & Lyle today announced the launch of a range of dietary fibres that will be marketed under a new brand – PROMITOR™. The brand name is taken from the Roman god associated with bringing the harvest in from the fields. PROMITOR™ fibres are the latest addition to the company’s Wellness platform__*__ which recognises that consumers are looking for great-tasting__*__ healthy options.
</p><p>Tate & Lyle will be developing a portfolio of soluble and insoluble dietary fibre ingredients under the PROMITOR™ brand__*__ with the first product launch just days away. Fibre is also a key ingredient in the bakery__*__ beverage and dairy prototypes launched under Tate & Lyle’s ENRICH™ service at the start of the year.
</p><p>The average adult diet in the USA does not contain the daily recommended intake (DRI) of fibre. Current intake for men and women ranges from 12 to 16 grams per day__*__ whereas the DRI stands at 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams per day for men[1]. In Europe__*__ the current intake varies by country[2] but still does not meet national recommendations[3]. 
</p><p>Tate & Lyle’s own research[4] found that around two thirds of respondents in the US and Europe[5] acknowledge that fibre helps to promote digestive health and the immune system__*__ with the majority recognising fibre’s ability to manage hunger and so potentially help in managing body weight. The research also found that 57% of surveyed US parents (54% Europe[6]) believe fibre to be useful in maintaining children’s health. However__*__ just 12% of US respondents (15% Europe[7]) hold the belief that products that help you maintain digestive health and the immune system can ‘taste good’. 
</p><p>Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas said__*__ “There is a real opportunity for food manufacturers to give consumers the fibre they ‘need to eat’ in the products they ‘want to eat’. The prototypes that we have taken to our customers show that PROMITOR™ branded dietary fibres are easily incorporated into a wide range of food and beverages with no impact on taste. Through our technical applications expertise and specially commissioned consumer research__*__ we can help our customers to develop differentiated products that add value for consumers.”
</p><p>Tate & Lyle’s customers will have the opportunity to use the PROMITOR™ logo front of pack as a symbol of great-tasting products with added fibre. The PROMITOR™ branded range of fibres is suitable for a broad range of food and beverage categories including beverages__*__ bakery__*__ dairy__*__ soups__*__ sauces & dressings__*__ snacks and cereal coatings.

578,auto,Legacy Import,6/8/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,DuPont Tate & Lyle Joint Venture Officially Opens $100 Million Bio-PDO™ Facility – the World’s First to Produce Propanediol From Corn Sugar,"<strong><em>U.S. Secretary of Energy Bodman Recognizes Advancements in Bio-Based Technology</em></strong> LOUDON__*__ Tenn.__*__ June 8__*__ 2007 &ndash; DuPont Tate &amp; Lyle Bio Products__*__ LLC__*__ an equally owned joint venture of DuPont and Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ today marked the growing demand for products made from its revolutionary Bio-PDO&trade; product here today. U.S. Secretary of Energy Samuel W. Bodman joined senior leaders from DuPont__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ the joint venture and their customers to see the new production facility first-hand and recognize its official opening. The Loudon facility produces 1__*__3-propanediol (Bio-PDO&trade;) from renewable resources &ndash; in this case corn sugar &ndash; making it the first facility in the world to manufacture this new bio-based product. Bio-PDO&trade; is a versatile__*__ biodegradable and high-performance ingredient that can be used in cosmetics__*__ liquid detergents and industrial applications such as anti-freeze and many other applications that currently use glycols. It also can be used as a monomer to produce unsaturated polyester resins as well as other specialty polymers such as DuPont&trade; Sorona&reg; and the latest renewably sourced polymer__*__ DuPont&trade; Cerenol&trade;. In addition__*__ renewably sourced Hytrel&reg; thermoplastic elastomers and a new line of renewable DuPont automotive finishes are two new product lines scheduled to be launched later this year. The first commercial product was sold in November 2006__*__ and demand for new uses of Bio-PDO&trade; continues to grow with nearly a dozen product applications to date. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s encouraging to see industry team up to make incredible advances in bio-based technology__*__ building upon the Department of Energy&rsquo;s efforts to reduce our reliance on imported oil__*__ aggressively confront climate change and help maintain our nation&rsquo;s competitive edge in the global marketplace__*__&rdquo; Secretary Bodman said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen tremendous examples today of how private sector investment can make available to consumers more affordable__*__ homegrown and environmentally sensitive products. I commend DuPont Tate &amp; Lyle Bio Products for taking bold steps to maximize domestically grown resources__*__ and I&rsquo;d like to see more of this type of collaboration.&rdquo; The joint venture uses a proprietary fermentation process developed jointly by DuPont and Tate &amp; Lyle to produce Bio-PDO&trade; using corn sugar instead of petroleum-based feedstocks. The production of Bio-PDO&trade; consumes 40 percent less energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to petroleum-based propanediol. Annual production of 100 million pounds of Bio-PDO&trade; will save the energy equivalent of over 15 million gallons of gasoline per year__*__ or enough to fuel more than 27__*__000 cars &ndash; over half the cars in Loudon County__*__ Tenn. At today&rsquo;s event__*__ the American Chemical Society (ACS) presented the research teams involved in the development of Bio-PDOTM with the prestigious 2007 Heroes of Chemistry award. The program highlights the vital role of industrial chemical scientists and their companies in improving human welfare through successful commercial innovations and products. Recipients are selected based on the technical merit of the chemical innovation__*__ including talent and foresight demonstrated by the nominees__*__ the commercial impact of the products on the marketplace__*__ and the benefits to mankind through the products&rsquo; performance. Representing the teams and organizations receiving the award were: Charlie Nakamura and Cathy Babowitz of DuPont__*__ Dennis Adkesson of Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ and Gregg Whited of Genencor International. &ldquo;The Loudon Bio-PDO&trade; production process is on the leading edge of industrial biotechnology__*__&rdquo; said DuPont Tate &amp; Lyle Bio Products President Steven Mirshak. &ldquo;We are quickly growing into a business that delivers high performing__*__ renewable products to diverse markets globally. This was the goal and vision of our parent companies. We are enabling our customers to produce high-quality__*__ renewably sourced products based on Susterra&trade; and Zemea&trade; propanediol.&rdquo; &ldquo;We began looking at bio-based__*__ renewable materials in 1993 as the natural evolution of DuPont science__*__&rdquo; DuPont Chairman &amp; CEO Charles O. Holliday__*__ Jr. said. &ldquo;Today__*__ the growth opportunity is exponential with applications in personal care__*__ automotive__*__ paints__*__ athletic equipment__*__ apparel and more. Bio-PDO&trade; has demonstrated that our approach to integrated science works. We are seeing further evidence of this in the development of advanced biofuels and other renewable products in our pipeline. I am more confident than ever that we as a society are making progress toward building a global economy that addresses energy challenges in a sustainable way.&rdquo; Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s Chief Executive Iain Ferguson said__*__ &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s event is the culmination of our companies working together to open up real commercial opportunities and drive scientific advancement. Industrial biotechnology that remains focused on the consumer can help businesses not only reduce their dependence on traditional petrochemical fuel sources &ndash; helping companies to cut costs and pollution &ndash; but also can deliver more choice and better products for consumers.&rdquo; Bio-PDO&trade; is available in two grades: Zemea&trade; and Susterra&trade; propanediol. Zemea&trade; has been developed for the personal care and liquid detergent categories where high purity level and low irritation are key product requirements. Susterra&trade; propanediol is ideal for industrial applications such as de-icing fluids__*__ anti-freeze and heat transfer fluids__*__ where its low toxicity and biodegradability are beneficial.

583,auto,Legacy Import,6/11/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle announces PROMITOR™ Resistant Starch as first ‘PROMITOR™' branded fibre,"<em>Tate &amp; Lyle would be delighted to discuss </em>PROMITOR&trade; <em>with delegates at Food Ingredients South America (Booth No. 110) and the Institute of Food Technologists Trade Show (Booth No. 140)</em> Tate &amp; Lyle today announced the launch of PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch__*__ the first ingredient to be marketed under its new PROMITOR&trade; range of dietary fibres. PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch will help manufacturers add more fibre to baked products and snacks (including cereal__*__ crackers__*__ cookies__*__ bread and pasta)__*__ with no impact on taste or texture. Resistant starch is a starch that &ldquo;resists&rdquo; digestion and acts as a dietary fibre. Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas said__*__ &ldquo;A typical diet in the US and Europe does not meet the daily recommended intake of fibre and this may be linked to low consumer expectations surrounding the taste and texture of high or added fibre products. Our research shows that consumers clearly understand that fibre can be good for their health. But we also know that the consumers&rsquo; eating experience must be about the product they&rsquo;ve chosen not the fibre that&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo; PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch is a prebiotic fibre[1] that is well-tolerated and has a low glycemic response. Depending on legislation__*__ it can be labelled as a corn starch/starch and may be suitable for products making a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; claim. Manufacturers can also use the PROMITOR&trade; logo front of pack to highlight its inclusion. Jim Miller__*__ Director of Product Management__*__ Americas__*__ said__*__ &ldquo;PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch is a step change in resistant starch technology. Other resistant starches do not survive well in extreme process conditions. Because of its superior process stability__*__ PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch can be used in smaller quantities to deliver better results. This means PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch is cost-efficient and has less impact on the formulation than other products currently on the market.&rdquo; PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch also has very low water holding capacity__*__ making it easy to formulate with when substituting for wheat flour in low moisture systems such as crackers and cookies. PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch has the added benefit in fried goods of reducing oil pick-up by 15-20%__*__ which means fewer calories and less fat in the end product. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s department of Health and Nutrition Sciences has worked with Leatherhead Food International to determine the prebiotic properties of PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch. This formed part of a wider research programme which includes a series of clinical studies on the PROMITOR&trade; range of fibres in partnership with a number of leading internationally recognized experts on fibre and health at various academic institutions. Tate &amp; Lyle will be developing a range of soluble and insoluble dietary fibre ingredients under the PROMITOR&trade; brand__*__ which can be used in a wide variety of applications. Newly developed product formulas with PROMITOR&trade; Resistant Starch include corn chips__*__ snack crackers__*__ corn puffs__*__ sandwich cookies and crisp chocolate chip cookies. Fibre is a key ingredient in the bakery__*__ beverage and dairy ENRICH&trade; prototypes__*__ the functional ingredients service launched by Tate &amp; Lyle at the start of the year. <br />

The programme is run jointly with the National Education Business Partnerships Network (NEBPN)__*__ and it was the Newham EBP who organised this visit to Thames Refinery. </p><p>Dr Robert Ditchfield__*__ Director of Education Affairs at the Royal Academy of Engineering__*__ said: “The STEPS at Work visit to Tate & Lyle was a most interesting__*__ informative and enjoyable day. Thames Refinery is a fine example of a modern processing plant and on a most impressive scale. We gained great insight into the science__*__ chemistry and technology involved in the day-to-day running of such a facility__*__ and many of the teachers found what they learned from the day directly applicable to their courses as case study material.

609,auto,Legacy Import,7/19/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle launches second PROMITOR™ dietary fiber,"<p>Tate &amp; Lyle today announced the launch of PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber__*__ the second fiber in the PROMITOR&trade; range. Made from corn__*__ the new fiber will initially be launched in the US__*__ with other geographies to follow. </p>
<p>Typical diets in the US and Europe do not meet the national recommendations for daily intake of fiber. PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber offers manufacturers a real opportunity to help consumers boost their fiber intake with innovative products that deliver the right texture and all the taste people expect from their favorite brands. It will help manufacturers add fiber to a wide range of foods and beverages including cereal coatings__*__ snacks__*__ soups__*__ sauces &amp; dressings__*__ jams__*__ fillings__*__ puddings__*__ confectionery__*__ beverages and dairy products.</p>
<p>PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber is a prebiotic fiber<a href=""https://www.tateandlyle.presscentre.com/backstage/contentManagement/otherareas/releaseUI.asp?NewsAreaID=2#_ftn1"" target=""_blank"">[1]</a> that is well-tolerated and has a low glycemic response. The new fiber has excellent process and acid stability and dissolves clear in applications. It is extremely easy to formulate with and can be used to replace traditional sweeteners such as liquid and dry corn sweeteners__*__ sucrose__*__ and sugar alcohols. Furthermore__*__ at only 2kcal/g__*__ PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber can be used to reduce calories while maintaining the texture and body imparted from nutritive sweeteners. </p>
<p>Jim Miller__*__ Director of Product Management__*__ Americas__*__ said__*__ &ldquo;Our goal was to deliver our customers__*__ and consumers__*__ high levels of fiber fortification in new product areas__*__ without any impact on taste or texture. With its exceptional clarity__*__ low viscosity__*__ and process stability__*__ PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber can be used in products where people wouldn&rsquo;t expect to find fiber such as sauces and dressings__*__ or clear beverages. This will enable consumers to incorporate more fiber in their everyday diet.&rdquo; </p>
<p>PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber offers consumer friendly labeling options and manufacturers can also use the PROMITOR&trade; logo front of pack to highlight its inclusion. Harvey Chimoff__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Americas__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ said__*__ &ldquo;Our recent consumer research shows that labels on products are among the most important sources of information on digestive health and immunity for consumers in the US. In the US__*__ parents often look to labels for advice and information on children&rsquo;s health. We believe Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s label-friendly Soluble Corn Fiber and co-branding opportunities offer an excellent point of difference for our customers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s Department of Health and Nutrition Sciences has worked with Leatherhead Food International to determine the prebiotic properties of PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber. These findings are part of a wider research program which includes a series of clinical studies on the PROMITOR&trade; range of fibers in partnership with a number of leading internationally recognized experts on fiber and health at various academic institutions. </p>
<p>Tate &amp; Lyle would be delighted to discuss PROMITOR&trade; with delegates at the Institute of Food Technologists Trade Show (Booth No. 140)__*__ where visitors can try a mini BBQ pork sandwich with cheese puffs__*__ chocolate pudding__*__ chocolate chip cookies__*__ sandwich cookie and flavored water with PROMITOR&trade; fibers__*__ all meeting a &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;excellent source of fiber&rdquo; claim.</p>
<p>PROMITOR&trade; Soluble Corn Fiber is available as a dry powder or in a convenient liquid form.</p>

611,auto,Legacy Import,7/18/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Chairman's AGM and Interim Management Statement,"At the Annual General Meeting of Tate &amp; Lyle PLC to be held in London today__*__ Sir David Lees__*__ Chairman__*__ will make the following statement:<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><br />
<br />
Trading Update</span> <br />
Trading in the current financial year has started in line with our expectations with total operating profit at constant exchange rates for the first three months similar to the prior year.<br />
<br />
Profit from continuing operations* at constant exchange rates was below the exceptionally strong first quarter of the prior year.<br />
<br />
Sales of SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose in the first quarter were ahead of the comparator period with customer de-stocking thus far having less of an effect than anticipated. The predicted increase in fixed costs arising from the start of production at the new Singapore facility impacted profits which nevertheless for the quarter were ahead of last year. At this stage of the year we continue to expect satisfactory sales growth for the year but that any increase in operating profit is likely to be modest and second half weighted. <br />
<br />
Profits from continuing operations* in the Ingredients divisions for the quarter were somewhat below last year. Whilst the main operations at Ingredients__*__ Americas were ahead of the prior year__*__ this was more than offset by lower returns from ethanol and citric acid. Profit from the continuing operations* in Ingredients__*__ Europe was better despite higher raw material prices. While corn prices in America have reduced following US Department of Agriculture forecasts of a good harvest this year__*__ prices for both wheat and corn in Europe have significantly increased. European sales prices will be increased where possible in order to offset these higher costs. <br />
<br />
Profits from continuing operations in the Sugar division as a whole were significantly lower than the comparative period principally due to a return to a more normal level of profitability in sugar trading and continuing difficult market conditions in the EU and Vietnam. <br />
<br />
The Group generated positive free cash flow for the three months to 30 June 2007. <br />
<br />
There have been no material changes to the Groups net assets since 31 March 2007. <br />
<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><br />
Transaction Update</span> <br />
In the last three months__*__ certain previously announced transactions have been completed or progressed as contributors to our strategy of creating a stronger value added business building on our low cost commodity base whilst__*__ at the same time__*__ reducing the impact of our exposure to volatile markets. <br />
<br />
The sale of Tate &amp; Lyle Canada Ltd for a net consideration of &pound;131 million was completed on 21 April 2007. The profit on disposal was &pound;55 million__*__ subject to closing adjustments__*__ and will be reflected as an exceptional item in the results for the first half year. <br />
<br />
On 15 June 2007 we completed the acquisition of an 80% holding in German specialty food ingredients group G. C. Hahn &amp; Co for a total cash consideration of &pound;78 million. This investment will broaden both our value added product offering and our customer base. <br />
<br />
In early May we announced that we were in exclusive discussions with Syral SAS (a subsidiary of Tereos of France) for the disposal of our interest in the facilities of Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe in the UK__*__ Belgium__*__ France__*__ Spain and Italy. We announced today that we have signed an agreement for the disposal of these facilities for a consideration of &euro;310 million (&pound;209 million)__*__ subject to closing adjustments. The disposal is expected to result in an exceptional loss of approximately &pound;20 million after restructuring costs. The transaction__*__ which is subject to antitrust approval__*__ will reduce the impact of our exposure to volatile markets and to the EU sugar regime. <br />
<br />
The disposal of our interest in Occidente__*__ our joint venture cane sugar producer in Mexico__*__ is being explored with a number of interested parties. At 31 March 2007 Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s share of the net operating assets of Occidente was &pound;42 million. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s share of the operating profit for the year to 31 March 2007 was &pound;6 million. Further announcements on this transaction will be made as appropriate. <br />
<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><br />
Outlook</span> <br />
As advised in our preliminary results statement we regard 2007/8 as a year of transition. The development of our core Ingredients and Sucralose businesses is progressing satisfactorily and our expectations for these businesses have not changed. As described above__*__ we are experiencing market weakness affecting our sugar__*__ ethanol and citric acid businesses and a challenging European cereals market. In addition__*__ the strength of sterling is likely to adversely impact our reported results and as a consequence__*__ our current expectation of continuing operations* results for the year to 31 March 2008 is slightly lower than when we announced our results for the previous financial year in May. <br />
<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><br />
Taxation</span> <br />
We have made good progress in improving our tax management and will be implementing revised financing arrangements over the next few months. The part year impact in 2007/08 is likely to be modest and is dependent on expected regulatory approval. The anticipated full-year saving in 2008/09 should be substantial. <br />
<span style=""text-decoration:underline;""><br />
Return of Capital to Shareholders</span> <br />
Subject to the renewal of authority from shareholders at today&rsquo;s AGM__*__ the Board intends to commence an on-market share buy back programme for an amount of up to &pound;275 million. In deciding on the quantum of the buy back programme__*__ the Board took into consideration the future capital expenditure requirements of the business__*__ discussions with the credit rating agencies and the importance we attach to maintaining our investment grade rating. *continuing operations relates to the Group as a whole less results relating to Redpath__*__ Eastern Sugar and those facilities of Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe which are being sold as announced today and referred to above.",

In fact when asked to identify which one they thought was the reduced calorie__*__ reduced sugar version &ndash; out of the 972 participants__*__ 49% picked the full-calorie__*__ full-sugar sample.</p>
<p>Dave Tuchler__*__ Vice President__*__ Brands__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle said__*__ &ldquo;Most people at IFT are food and beverage experts but many could not distinguish between the two and had to make a guess__*__ hence the 51:49 split. Achieving this demonstrates the real potential for beverage manufacturers to replace a proportion of nutritive sweetener with SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose at no expense to taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The results confirm the success of what Tate &amp; Lyle has styled &ldquo;Sweetener Optimization&rdquo;. This helps manufacturers replace a proportion of high fructose corn syrup or sugar in beverages with SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose__*__ while retaining the flavor and sweetness profile of the original full-sugar product. The aim of Sweetener Optimization is not to find the mid-point between diet and full calorie but to determine the optimal level of nutritive sweeteners that can be replaced without affecting the flavor profile and other characteristics of the beverage. </p>
<p>With issues such as childhood obesity on the rise__*__ sugar and calorie reduction is ever relevant for today&rsquo;s beverage manufacturers. Sweetener Optimization enables manufacturers to offer calorie savings but without the need to acclimatize to new tasting products. Reducing nutritive sweetener content can also deliver cost savings to the manufacturer.</p>

660,auto,Legacy Import,9/28/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Trading Update,"In line with its regular practice__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading update prior to entering a closed period in respect of the interim results to 30 September 2007. The interim results will be announced on Wednesday<strong>__*__ </strong>31 October 2007. A copy of the proforma results for the six months to 30 September 2006 in the revised segmental reporting format is attached for reference.
<strong>FIRST HALF OUTTURN</strong>
First half results from SPLENDA&reg;<strong> </strong>Sucralose and continuing* operations in our US and European Ingredients businesses are expected to be similar to those in the prior year on a constant currency basis. However__*__ our sugars business has experienced a substantial reduction in the performance of sugar trading__*__ which__*__ after a particularly difficult August__*__ is now forecasting a small loss for the first half against a profit of &pound;15 million in the comparable period. As advised in our statement at the Annual General Meeting on 18 July 2007__*__ the translation impact of weakness of the US Dollar is expected to reduce pre-tax profits for the first half. We estimate this impact to be approximately &pound;12 million over the comparable period.
<strong>DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE </strong>
In <strong>Ingredients__*__ Americas</strong> sales and profits of value added starches have improved as expected. This progress has been offset to some extent by a weaker HFCS market. As previously indicated__*__ ethanol profits have been well below last year&rsquo;s exceptional levels. Operating losses and closure costs of Astaxanthin (which was announced on 16 August 2007 and will be reported in continuing operations) are expected to total &pound;5 million in the first half year.
Total operations in <strong>Ingredients__*__ Europe</strong> have performed ahead of the prior year with continuing operations in line with the prior year. The well publicised increase in European wheat costs further supports our decision to dispose of our interest in the facilities in the UK__*__ Belgium__*__ France__*__ Spain and Italy to Syral SAS (a subsidiary of French cooperative group Tereos). We expect this transaction to close in the next few days and the businesses concerned will be treated as discontinued operations in the interim results. Once this disposal completes__*__ we will have no exposure to wheat. We are pleased with the operating performance of the German specialty food ingredients group G. C. Hahn &amp; Co__*__ which joined the Group on 15 June 2007.
Profits for <strong>SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose</strong> have been similar to the prior year on a constant currency basis. Sales have grown__*__ with customer de-stocking thus far having less of an effect than anticipated__*__ though we believe that surplus inventories continue to be held by some of our customers. The start-up of the Singapore plant is proceeding well.
Profits from continuing operations in the <strong>Sugars division</strong> have been sharply lower than in the comparative period principally due to a forecast small loss in sugar trading for the first half compared to a profit of &pound;15 million in the prior year. Molasses trading has made a good start to the year and we expect sugar trading to be profitable in the second half. The European refining businesses have performed in line with our expectations and are making good progress in improving efficiency and competitiveness.
<strong>EU SUGAR REGIME</strong>
We welcome the announcement by the Commission on 26 September regarding agreement on a package of measures to repair and strengthen the reform of the EU sugar regime. The changes are designed to make the restructuring fund more attractive to both beet growers and processors given that it has performed below expectations in the first two years of its four year term. The result of the agreement is expected to be an increase in the surrender of quota starting with the next deadline for surrender on 31 January 2008. The Commission is aiming for a further 3.8 million tonnes of quota to be surrendered under these improved conditions in order to bring the EU sugar market back into the supply and demand balance envisaged in the original November 2005 agreement on sugar reform. Whilst these changes will have little direct benefit to our sugar refineries__*__ which are not part of the restructuring fund__*__ we believe that in the long term a balanced and stable market is good for the whole industry.
<strong>TAXATION</strong>
Although the overall tax rate for the Group as a whole is forecast at approximately 30% for the year to 31 March 2008__*__ the restructuring following the disposal of businesses in Western Europe (together with their associated tax losses) is expected to result in a proforma effective tax rate for continuing business in the current year of approximately 34%. Implementation of revised financing arrangements__*__ which remain dependent upon regulatory approval__*__ is progressing satisfactorily and we continue to expect a substantial reduction in the effective tax charge for the next financial year__*__ albeit from this higher base.
<strong>OTHER ITEMS</strong>
In line with previous guidance__*__ interest costs are higher than the prior year. The share buyback programme has commenced with 8.8 million shares having been bought by close of business on 27 September at a total cash consideration of &pound;48.5 million.
Exceptional items are expected to include a &pound;55 million profit on the disposal of Redpath in Canada and an estimated loss on disposal of facilities of Ingredients__*__ Europe of &pound;20 million.
<strong><br />
</strong>
<strong>OUTLOOK</strong>
Three particular factors influence the outlook for our continuing businesses.
Firstly__*__ while our continuing Ingredients__*__ Europe businesses have performed satisfactorily in the first half__*__ as our cover on raw materials expires the significantly higher corn (maize) costs in Europe will__*__ if sustained__*__ have an increasingly severe effect on the profitability of this division. Sales prices will be increased where possible in order to offset these higher costs but we think it prudent at this stage to assume only modest profits from these businesses in the second half year.
Secondly__*__ the ongoing dispute between the USA and the EU over genetically modified corn has resulted in US corn gluten feed exports to the EU being prohibited. This has caused oversupply in the USA and has depressed by-product prices and margins. It is not clear when this dispute will be resolved.
Thirdly__*__ the translation impact of weakness of the US Dollar will__*__ if sustained__*__ reduce pre-tax results in the second half of the year__*__ although to a lesser extent than that forecast for the first half.
Given the importance of these factors__*__ the Board views the near term outlook with caution. However__*__ our trading experience during this transitional year reinforces the importance of__*__ and our confidence in__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s strategy of building a stronger value added business whilst reducing our exposure to volatile markets and regulated regimes.
<strong>CONFERENCE CALL</strong>
A conference call for analysts and investors will be held at 8.30 am today. The call will be hosted by John Nicholas__*__ Group Finance Director and Mark Robinson__*__ Director of Investor Relations. Participants are requested to dial in at least 5 minutes before the commencement of the call. Dial in details are:

680,auto,Legacy Import,10/23/2007,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle and Lipid Nutrition partner to develop new ENRICH™ ingredient systems with PinnoThin™__*__ Clarinol™ and Marinol™,"Tate & Lyle and Lipid Nutrition today announced that they have entered into an exclusive new partnership. Tate & Lyle will develop new ENRICH™ ingredient systems for soups__*__ sauces and dressings which incorporate Lipid Nutrition’s PinnoThin™ pine nut oil__*__ Clarinol™ conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and Marinol™ fish oils and powders. The agreement means that Tate & Lyle will have the exclusive rights to market PinnoThin™__*__ Clarinol™ and Marinol™ in Europe__*__ the Middle East and Africa in the soups__*__ sauces and dressings category. In return Lipid Nutrition will gain access to Tate & Lyle’s technical knowledge__*__ applications support and extensive customer base in this category.

Netherlands-based Lipid Nutrition is a producer of specialised lipids__*__ which improve and maintain health and well-being and has developed and patented a unique and 100 per cent natural product called PinnoThin™. PinnoThin™ has been shown to suppress the desire to eat by promoting a feeling of satiety (fullness) and helping to reduce the excessive consumption of calories. It is suitable for vegetarians and can be used in a range of applications including dairy__*__ beverages__*__ spreads__*__ bakery and confectionery. Appetite suppressants currently account for 13 per cent of the slimming aids market__*__ and with obesity set to overtake smoking as the most important cause of heart disease__*__ it is not surprising that satiety is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential major contributor to successful weight management. 

Clarinol™ concentrated CLA has been shown to improve body composition by reducing body fat and increase lean muscle mass in the specific areas of the body where fat loss is most desired. 

The range of Marinol™ naturally concentrated fish oils and powders offer opportunities for enrichment of omega-3 fatty acids via functional foods for heart and brain health. It offers different EPA and DHA[1] ratios to provide the specific health benefits. This makes it possible to enhance and customise a wide variety of food products.

Tate & Lyle ENRICH™ was launched as part of Tate & Lyle’s CORE™ offering earlier this year__*__ to enable food and beverage manufacturers to create products that are packed with additional nutrients but taste as good as regular brands. The service focuses on three main areas - Digestive Health and Immunity__*__ Obesity and Weight Management and Children’s Health.

James Blunt__*__ Tate & Lyle’s Product Management Director Europe__*__ said__*__ “Our partnership with Lipid Nutrition is an exciting development for Tate & Lyle’s ENRICH™ service and our health and wellness platform overall. PinnoThin™ and Clarinol™ will be incorporated in ENRICH™ systems for obesity and weight management. Marinol™ will be used in our ENRICH™ concepts for children’s health and in time may open up opportunities in areas such as heart health. Our R&D teams have already started to develop a range of ENRICH™ prototypes with these ingredients. This means more choice for our customers and enables them to develop consumer products with a health proposition targeted to specific market segments.”

We are delighted to be working with Tate & Lyle and believe this partnership can give a huge boost to the market__*__” said John Kurstjens__*__ Lipid Nutrition’s Global Marketing Manager. “Lipid Nutrition holds a leadership position with these ingredients for dietary supplements and functional foods__*__ and this partnership provides us with a great opportunity to further extend the application areas for our innovative products.”

The first product prototype to be developed through the new partnership - Soup ENRICH™ - will be showcased at Food Ingredients Europe later this month (30th October – 1st November__*__ Tate & Lyle stand no. C141 and Lipid Nutrition stand no H41).

<br/><a href='https://www.tateandlyle.presscentre.com/backstage/contentManagement/otherareas/releaseUI.asp?NewsAreaID=2#_ftnref1' target='_blank'>[1]</a> EPA stands for eicosapentaenoic acid__*__ DHA for docosapentaenoic acid. These are two types of fatty acids which belong to the omega 3 family__*__ and these fatty acids generate the health benefit for omega 3. There are many types of omega 3 fatty acids also in food products__*__ but EPA and DHA are needed for the health benefits.

</span><br />
Ian Bacon__*__ Chief Executive Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars__*__ said: &ldquo;Having recently confirmed what we&rsquo;d already anticipated__*__ that our carbon footprint is low at 0.43 tonnes per 1 tonne of sugar__*__<a href=""https://www.tateandlyle.presscentre.com/backstage/contentmanagement/otherareas/releaseUI.asp?NewsAreaID=2#_ftn1"" target=""_blank"">[1]</a> we are now proud to be taking steps to reduce that even further with this project. This is more than a pledge - it's happening now__*__ with construction already started. Furthermore__*__ we believe the boiler being constructed at our Thames site is not only the largest of its kind for London__*__ but also a first for the UK food and drink industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">The new biomass boiler will mean Tate &amp; Lyle can switch to renewable biomass to supply 70% of the energy needs of its London refinery. Post 2009__*__ with the boiler working at full capacity__*__ the carbon footprint of cane sugar produced at the UK refinery will be reduced to 0.32 tonnes per 1 tonne of sugar.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Bacon adds: &ldquo;At Tate &amp; Lyle we have an overall target to reduce energy consumption by 3% per annum and this has been in place since 2000. In addition__*__ we are currently a net-exporter to the National Grid at the refinery and once the biomass project is complete__*__ the source will be green.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Commenting in support of the biomass project__*__ Callton Young__*__ Director of Sustainability and Competitiveness at the Food &amp; Drink Federation (FDF)__*__ said: &ldquo;Climate change is perhaps the biggest challenge facing the planet. FDF is therefore absolutely delighted by Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s plans for reducing the carbon footprint of its products at its Thames Cane Sugar Refinery. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">&ldquo;The planned 70% reduction in CO2 emissions associated with energy use is significant by any standards. Indeed__*__ it is exemplary. It is exactly the sort of change in behaviour that FDF is encouraging under our Five-fold Environmental Ambition launched last month. If more companies follow Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s example__*__ a low carbon economy will quickly cease to be an aspiration and become a reality.&rdquo; </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Efforts to reduce carbon emissions at the Thames refinery are part of Tate &amp; Lyle's group-wide environmental and energy saving measures__*__ which has seen energy consumption per unit of output reduced by 1.2%; water consumption per unit of output reduced by 2.5%; and non hazardous solid waste consumption per unit of output reduced by 29.5% in the last year (calendar year 2006).</p>

Tate & Lyle Ventures forms part of a consortium which has invested third-round funding of $3.35 million. The consortium comprises a number of prominent angel investment groups including the Tech Coast Angels__*__ who focus on investing in early stage companies in Southern California and are leading the investment.</p><p>Allylix’s technology platform allows terpenes__*__ the class of natural products that gives plants their characteristic flavours and fragrances__*__ to be produced via fermentation in yeast. Allylix’s technology replaces the costly and laborious extraction of terpenes from plants and enables the cost effective production of flavours and fragrances for perfumes__*__ personal care__*__ food and household markets. </p><p>“Allylix has developed promising proprietary technology and a solid business model for its commercial terpene product line__*__ which is what initially attracted us to the company__*__” says Stephen Block__*__ lead investor for the Tech Coast Angels. “The market growth and revenue potential for Allylix’s products are enormous. Allylix’s low-cost process reduces the costs of producing terpenes to as little as 10% of what to date have been the very high costs of traditional processes__*__ thereby making these valuable compounds available to a wide variety of new market applications.”</p><p>Initially__*__ Allylix will focus on a class of terpenes called sesquiterpenes. Sesquiterpenes are part of the $1.9 billion aroma chemical segment of the flavour and fragrance market. However__*__ current prices for sesquiterpenes tend to be very high due to the limited supply of quality starting materials and the high cost of extraction and purification throughout the industry. Allylix has identified a number of sesquiterpene flavours and fragrances whose markets would expand substantially if there were a low cost alternative.</p><p>Simon Barnes__*__ Managing Partner of Tate & Lyle Ventures said__*__ “This is a significant development for the fragrance and flavour market. Not only can Allylix produce fragrances and flavours via a cost-effective route but the technology is also there to create entirely novel fragrances and flavours. Allylix’s fermentation technology is an excellent fit with our fund’s focus on renewable ingredients and bio-technology.” </p><p>“With research and development nearing completion__*__ we will use the substantial capital raised from these renowned angel investors and venture capitalists__*__ to launch our initial product line for the flavour and fragrance market__*__” said Carolyn Fritz__*__ chief executive officer of Allylix. </p><p><strong>About Allylix__*__ Inc.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>With business offices in San Diego CA and research and development laboratories in Lexington__*__ KY__*__ Allylix__*__ Inc. develops fine chemicals and valuable production platforms for the pharmaceutical__*__ nutraceutical__*__ agricultural and flavour & fragrance markets. Allylix's technology can produce high-value chemicals identical to those found in nature but in greater quantities__*__ of higher quality and purity and at lower production costs than traditional sources that rely on extracting the chemicals from rare biological sources or costly and low yielding chemical synthesis. Allylix's technology is based on research developed at the University of Kentucky and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

<br />
Shanghai__*__ China - More than one hundred food and beverage industry professionals attended a Health &amp; Wellness Seminar on December 13__*__ 2007 organized by Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s new Asia Pacific team based in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The theme of the seminar was: &ldquo;If your consumers love the taste of sugar__*__ they&rsquo;ll love SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose&rdquo;__*__ which is also the tag line for the new SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose ingredient advertising targeted to manufacturers in China. </p>
<p>Guests were invited to taste different food and beverage prototype samples formulated with SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose. These samples were prepared by the local Tate &amp; Lyle R&amp;D team in the company&rsquo;s newly established Shanghai applications centre. In general__*__ guests were unable to differentiate the taste of SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose from sugar__*__ and were surprised to see how low-sugar and low-calorie products can match the taste and texture of full sugar__*__ full calorie products.</p>
<p>Seminar highlights included:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Benefits of a Balanced Diet</strong></li>
</ul>
Dr. Susan Potter__*__ Vice President Health and Nutrition Sciences (Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ USA) shared learnings from the United States which highlighted the importance of a balanced diet - including the benefits of consuming food and beverages with an improved nutritional profile__*__ such as lower sugar and lower calorie products.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Obesity and Diabetes Trends in China</strong></li>
</ul>
Cai Meiqin__*__ Professor of Nutritional Science at the School of Medicine__*__Shanghai Jiaotong University presented an overview of rising obesity in China and explained the related growth of diabetes among the Chinese. Professor Cai noted the increasing rates of these two diseases among Chinese children and the link to their changed nutrition habits. <br />
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consumer Opportunity for Low Sugar Products</strong></li>
</ul>
Ms. S.K. Hui__*__ Director of Marketing__*__ Asia Pacific__*__ provided a short preview of Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s new Chinese consumer research study__*__ which included eight major cities in the country in phase 1__*__ to be followed with eleven cities in 2008. Of interest to food and beverage manufacturers__*__ the study&rsquo;s preliminary findings point to the opportunity for great tasting low sugar products in the Chinese market. Chinese consumers report that current available low sugar products fail to pass their taste preferences for repeat purchase.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Global Success for SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose in Food and Beverage Products</strong></li>
</ul>
Mr. Jordi Ferre__*__ Vice President Sales and Marketing__*__ Sucralose__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ USA and Mr. Chris Fang__*__ Regional Sales Manager__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ China demonstrated how close the taste profile is between SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose and sugar__*__ and how SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose contributes to the success of a wide range of commercial products across the world.

In 2006 Lyle&rsquo;s Golden Syrup was recognised by the Guinness World Records as having the world&rsquo;s oldest branding (packaging). So__*__ why fix it if it ain&rsquo;t broke? Well__*__ after 125 years of keeping it&rsquo;s goldenness on the inside__*__ now seems like a great time to go gold all round and celebrate 125 years in style!</p>
<p>When it comes to foods that like to take their time__*__ Lyle&rsquo;s Golden Syrup surely takes the biscuit; or should that be the flapjack? Deliciously thick and silky smooth__*__ people have been coaxing it from its iconic tin to add its Midas touch to porridge and pancakes__*__ puds and cookies__*__ since Victorian times. Now (2008)__*__ this gooey golden elixir__*__ which flows so slow and majestic from its green and gold casing__*__ celebrates its 125th birthday; proving it&rsquo;s as much loved today as it ever was. </p>
<p>In a stroke of luck in 1883__*__ it was canny Scottish businessman Abraham Lyle who discovered this treacly syrup could be refined to make a delicious sweet spread. The rest__*__ as they say__*__ is history!</p>
<p>Despite being one of the most familiar sights in kitchen cupboards across Britain__*__ usage isn&rsquo;t strictly restricted to baking and drizzling&hellip;</p>
<p>&middot; Gymnasts sometimes use it instead of talc for better grip!</p>
<p>&middot; Make-up artists have been known to use it mixed with red food dye to create fake blood for films</p>
<p>&middot; It&rsquo;s used by a volcano lab in the Alps to simulate the movement of lava</p>
<p>Established the same year as the first electric railway (1883)__*__ Lyle&rsquo;s Golden Syrup is older than the first petrol motorcar (built 1885) and wireless radio (1895); it precedes Coca Cola (est. 1886)__*__ Marmite (est. 1902)__*__ and Cadbury&rsquo;s Dairy Milk (est. 1905); and even predates Einstein&rsquo;s best-known equation of E = mc2! </p>

762,auto,Legacy Import,2/15/2008,Press releases,For Immediate Release,INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT,<p>Tate & Lyle PLC issues the following management statement covering the period from 1 October 2007 to 31 January 2008.</p><p>Profit before tax for the continuing operations for the period was marginally ahead of our expectations. This has reinforced the Board’s overall expectations as set out at the presentation of our interim results__*__ that the outturn for our continuing operations in the second half of the year to 31 March 2008 will be broadly similar to that of the first six months (1). </p><p>Key points for the four months ended January 2008 are:</p><ul><li>Good performance in our Americas ingredients operations__*__ somewhat ahead of our expectations__*__ in particular benefiting from improved by-product pricing. </li><li>At constant exchange rates sucralose sales grew compared with the prior year period but profits were lower due to higher patent defence and Singapore plant fixed costs. </li><li>The EU sugar market remains difficult__*__ but news of beet production quota surrender demonstrates the determination of the EU Commission and the industry to ensure a positive outcome to the Sugar Regime reform. </li></ul>(1) The profit before tax for the first six months of the year ending 31 March 2008 from continuing operations__*__ after adjusting for exceptional items and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the reclassification of the profit before tax for Occidente from continuing operations to discontinued operations__*__ was £117 million. TRADING PERFORMANCE <p>The<b> Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas</b> division continues to perform well and was somewhat ahead of our expectations with further strong performances from both value added food ingredients and commodity products__*__ which benefited from firmer by-product revenues. Strong demand from feed compounders in the USA__*__ who are using higher incorporation rates of the by-product corn gluten feed as a replacement for higher priced corn__*__ has decreased the reliance on exports. After a weak summer__*__ the HFCS market improved in the period. As expected__*__ ethanol returns were lower in the four months to the end of January 2008 than in the comparative period of the prior year__*__ but prices have improved following the December 2007 passage of the Energy Bill__*__ requiring the use in the USA of 9 billion gallons of ethanol in 2008 and 15 billion gallons by 2015. New food ingredient capacity at the Sagamore plant in Lafayette__*__ Indiana is on stream and will further benefit our value added performance. The sale of an investment in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange__*__ which was anticipated at the time of the announcement of our interim results__*__ contributed a one-off £4 million (US$7 million) to profit.</p><p>Initial proceeds of £197 million from the sale of five starch plants from the <b>Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe</b> division were received in October 2007 and a further £17 million was received in December 2007. The separation of the continuing operations and the closure of the Aalst__*__ Belgium head office were completed successfully in the period. In the recent pricing round__*__ the continuing operations recovered__*__ where possible__*__ higher net corn costs through selling price increases. However margins on sweetener products__*__ the price of which is capped by the regulated price of sugar__*__ remained under pressure. Corn has been purchased for the remainder of the financial year. Good progress continued in food ingredients__*__ including the recently acquired GC Hahn business__*__ whose performance over the four months to January 2008 continues to be in line with expectations__*__ and where integration with the Group is progressing well. As stated in the interim results announcement__*__ profits in the second six months of the year for the continuing operations__*__ including GC Hahn and Cesalpinia__*__ will be modest__*__ although in line with our expectations. </p><p><b>Sucralose</b> sales at constant exchange rates for the period improved compared with the prior year. Sales growth continues across all territories. With the successful start-up of the Singapore plant__*__ ahead of schedule__*__ we have seen customer de-stocking and anticipate this will largely be complete by the end of the financial year. However profits for the period__*__ after taking into account the legal costs incurred in patent defence and the higher fixed costs due to the Singapore plant__*__ were lower than in the prior year at constant exchange rates__*__ and this trend is expected to continue for the rest of the financial year. The trial in our US International Trade Commission (ITC) litigation against a number of Chinese manufacturers and distributors concerning alleged infringement of certain of our patents is in court later this month. The judge’s initial determination is expected in June 2008__*__ leading to a final ruling by the ITC in October 2008. </p><p>Within the <b>Sugars</b> division__*__ our EU sugar refineries continued to operate within a challenging market and__*__ in the four months to January 2008__*__ performed in line with the first half year. Profits excluding transitional aid were slightly higher in the period than the prior year. We welcome the recent announcements of quota surrender by some of the major EU beet sugar producers. We are encouraged by the initial reaction to the measures announced in September 2007 by the EU Commission to repair and strengthen the EU Sugar Regime reforms with the aim of removing a further 3.8 million tonnes of production to bring supply of sugar in line with EU demand. Quota surrendered for the sugar year starting 1 October 2008 will be published by the Commission in April. If supply and demand are brought into balance the impact will be felt in the market only towards the end of the next financial year__*__ so market conditions can be expected to remain difficult in the short term. International sugar trading has made a small loss in the period due to lower volumes. A similar pattern is expected for the remainder of the year and international sugar trading is therefore now likely to show a loss for the full year. As discussed at the presentation of our interim results__*__ we regard international sugar trading as a valuable activity and we are examining ways to ensure more stable results in future. We will provide an update at the presentation of our full year results in May. Molasses trading continued its good performance__*__ and the combined molasses and international sugar trading operations were profitable in the period.</p><p>The sale of our 49% stake in Occidente__*__ the Mexican joint venture__*__ completed in December 2007 and proceeds of £47 million have been received. The results of Occidente were recorded within continuing operations in the interim results. Following the disposal the results (sales of £29 million and operating profit of £3 million for the six months to September 2007) will be reclassified as discontinued.</p><p>The review of our <b>Central Costs</b> following recent changes to the composition of the Group is largely complete and we will report further in May.</p><p><br/></p><p>TAXATION</p><p>We expect the effective tax rate for the continuing operations to be in line with the 34.4% applied to the interim results. The precise final rate will depend on the geographic mix of profits.</p><p>RETURN OF CAPITAL</p><p>Following approval from shareholders at the AGM in July 2007__*__ we had acquired by the close of business on 14 February 33.6 million shares (6.9% of the issued share capital at the time of the AGM) for a total cash consideration of £159 million. The Company holds 2__*__908__*__135 ordinary shares in Treasury and has 456__*__856__*__886 ordinary shares in issue (excluding Treasury shares).</p><p>EXCHANGE RATES</p><p>If the sterling : US dollar exchange rate continues at the assumed level of 1.96 for the remainder of the financial year the average rate for the second six months would be 2.00__*__ compared with the average rate of 2.04 assumed at the time of the interim results announcement. On this basis__*__ we would now anticipate a reduction in profit before tax of £14 million for the year as a whole (£16 million reduction anticipated at the time of the interim results announcement) from exchange translation by comparison with the prior year. </p><p>NET DEBT</p><p>Net debt at the end of January 2008 was £982 million compared with £840 million at 30 September 2007. Movements in exchange rates contributed approximately £30 million to the increase in debt. During the period__*__ £94 million was spent on the repurchase of our own shares and £31 million on the payment of the interim dividend.</p><p>SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHANGE</p><p>D. Lynn Grider__*__ President__*__ Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas and a member of the Tate & Lyle Group Management Committee is retiring from the Group in July 2008. Lynn has made a huge contribution to Tate & Lyle over his 35 years with the Group. Matthew Wineinger<b> </b>has been appointed<b> </b>to succeed Lynn. Matt will be joining Tate & Lyle on 3 March 2008 to ensure a smooth handover. Matt has had a distinguished career with a number of major companies in the food sector__*__ including Swift__*__ Cargill__*__ Monsanto and Novartis.</p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>Profit before tax for the continuing operations for the four months from 1 October 2007 to 31 January 2008 was marginally ahead of our expectations. Taking into account the above exchange rate assumptions__*__ this has reinforced the Board’s overall expectations as set out at the presentation of our interim results__*__ that the expected outturn for our continuing operations in the second half of the year to 31 March 2008 will be broadly similar to that of the first six months. <b>END</b></p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8.30am__*__ hosted by Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive and John Nicholas__*__ Group Finance Director.

In terms of size and scale__*__ this is the biggest ever Fairtrade switch by a UK company and it’s tremendous this iconic UK brand is backing Fairtrade.

o        The FAIRTRADE Mark is the only independent consumer label that ensures farmers in developing countries receive an agreed and stable price for the crops they grow that covers the cost of sustainable production__*__ as well as additional payment (known as the Fairtrade premium) for farmers and workers to invest together in the future.  

 

o        Retail sales of Fairtrade certified products topped £290 million in 2006 and have grown 40% year-on-year over the past five years. Awareness levels of the FAIRTRADE Mark among the UK population reached their highest level last year at 57% (TNS Omnibus). 

 

o        Raw cane sugar is almost carbon neutral.  Cane grows in the field__*__ fibre from the cane (bagasse) powers the factory and the cane re-grows each year__*__ often up to 10 times without the need for replanting.  It is then transported by ship to the UK refinery; producing small levels of CO2 emissions per tonne shipped.

 

o        Tate & Lyle’s carbon footprint is low at 0.43kg per 1kg of sugar in store; this will be reduced by a further 25% following the installation of a new £20m biomass boiler at the Thames refinery.

790,auto,Legacy Import,7/2/2008,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Disposal of International Sugar Trading,<p>Tate & Lyle PLC (“Tate & Lyle”) announces the sale of its international sugar trading operations to Bunge Limited (“Bunge”) for an undisclosed amount. </p><p>The disposal__*__ which is conditional on anti-trust approval in a small number of countries__*__ represents another step in delivering on Tate & Lyle’s strategy of reducing its exposure to volatile commodity markets.</p><p>As a first stage__*__ the operations and the employees of the international sugar trading business will transfer to Bunge. The working capital in the business will remain with__*__ and be collected and paid by__*__ Tate & Lyle through to 31 March 2009 at which point it will be assumed by Bunge upon final completion of the transaction. </p><p>The disposal will allow Tate & Lyle Sugars to concentrate on its core sugar refining operations. In conjunction with the sale__*__ the raw cane sugar sourcing team in the Group’s EU sugar refining operations is being strengthened to ensure it has the appropriate resources going forward to support and develop its key supplier relationships.</p><p>Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive of Tate & Lyle said: </p><p>“Our international sugar trading operation is a good business. However__*__ the recent sale of our sugar businesses in the Americas and the restrictions on exports from our EU cane sugar refineries__*__ which were implemented as part of the EU Sugar Regime reforms__*__ have reduced the value of international sugar trading to Tate & Lyle. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees in this business for their commitment and hard work over the years and wish them every future success within the Bunge organization.”</p><p>The gross assets attributable to the business being sold had a value of £288 million at 31 March 2008; net operating assets had a value of £106 million at 31 March 2008 and related primarily to working capital. A small number of minority interests related to the sugar trading business are not included in the sale and will be addressed separately over the coming months in accordance with the related shareholders' agreements. The sale of the international sugar trading business and the anticipated disposal of the minority interests are together unlikely to generate a material profit or loss on disposal; the sale of some of the minority interests may occur in the 2010 financial year.</p>,"1. Tate & Lyle’s international sugar trading business made an operating profit of £2 million in the two months to 31 May 2008__*__ an operating loss of £9 million in the year ended 31 March 2008__*__ and an operating profit of £22 million in the year ended 31 March 2007.  

2. The results of this business will be reclassified as discontinued operations. A restatement of Tate & Lyle’s accounts for the six months ended 31 September 2007 and for the year ended 31 March 2008 will be published on the Company’s website www.tateandlyle.com.

3. The sale excludes Tate & Lyle’s shareholding in its subsidiary in Israel__*__ Tate & Lyle Gadot Manufacturing__*__ and the minority interests in sugar facilities in Saudi Arabia__*__ Egypt and Thailand.

These were partially offset by some additional costs as we commission new technology at the Loudon__*__ Tennessee corn wet mill. </p><p>Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe’s improved co-product prices compensated for higher energy prices. The Food Systems businesses (Hahn and Cesalpinia) continued to perform well. </p><p>Sucralose sales volume growth was strong and consistent with our capacity utilisation targets. As anticipated__*__ sales values increased at a lower rate. Higher energy costs were offset by efficiency gains. The Singapore facility was commissioned in June 2007__*__ and so the first quarter of the current financial year includes the impact of a full quarter of costs associated with this new plant.</p><p>The EU sugar businesses__*__ as has been widely reported__*__ are operating in a very difficult market while surplus stock is absorbed in anticipation of the first reduction in the EU reference prices which will take place on 1 October 2008 (when the raw sugar reference price will also reduce). Gas prices at the UK refinery have been higher than expected__*__ further validating the investment in the biomass boiler which will be commissioned at the end of the current financial year ending 31 March 2009. We are increasingly confident that__*__ during the second half of the financial year__*__ market equilibrium between supply and demand for EU sugar will be restored__*__ which should lead to progressively firmer refining margins. </p><p>On 2 July we announced the sale of the international sugar trading business to Bunge Limited. The approvals required have now been obtained and the sale is unconditional. As already announced__*__ the working capital in the business will remain with__*__ and be collected and paid by__*__ Tate & Lyle through to 31 March 2009 at which point it will be assumed by Bunge upon final completion of the transaction. At 31 March 2008__*__ the net operating assets attributable to the business being sold had a value of £106 million and related primarily to working capital.</p><p>The business sold reported an operating profit of £4 million for the three months__*__ which compares with a loss of £6 million for the six month period ended 30 September 2007 and with a £9 million loss for the year to 31 March 2008. The results of international sugar trading have now been reclassified into discontinued operations. As a consequence the sale will have an impact on the comparison of the continuing operations’ profits with the equivalent period in the prior year in both the first and second half years.</p><p>As previously advised__*__ the Group’s tax rate is sensitive to the geographical mix of profits__*__ with profits from the UK covered by tax losses while US profits are typically taxed at between 37% and 39%. The disposal of international sugar trading increases the tax rate of the continuing operations as this business contributed to earnings in the UK. Given these factors and the performance of UK sugar refining__*__ we would now anticipate a tax rate for the full year in the region of 31% for the continuing operations.</p><p>Group net debt at 30 June 2008 was £967 million compared with £1__*__041 million at 31 March 2008. </p><p>OUTLOOK FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS</p><p>The general deterioration in global economic conditions__*__ particularly in the USA and specifically in raw materials and energy__*__ makes any statement about the outlook more difficult than usual. Nevertheless__*__ with three months of the financial year behind us and with three of the four divisions having started the year in line with our expectations__*__ we are on track to make progress for the year as a whole.</p><p>Note 1: Continuing operations do not include international sugar trading as__*__ following the announcement of its sale on 2 July 2008__*__ it has been classified as a discontinued operation.</p><p><b>END</b></p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8.00am BST__*__ hosted by Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive and John Nicholas__*__ Group Finance Director.

796,auto,Legacy Import,9/18/2008,Press releases,For Immediate Release,TRADING UPDATE,<p>Tate & Lyle issues the following trading update for the six months ending 30 September 2008 ahead of the announcement of the interim results on Thursday__*__ 6 November 2008. In light of the Board change announced earlier today__*__ we have brought forward this update by a few days.</p><p>Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive__*__ said: “The Group continues to trade satisfactorily. We expect profits from the Group’s continuing operations in the first half year to be broadly in line with the corresponding period in the prior year and our own expectations.” </p><p>TRADING UPDATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2008</p><p>At our Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas division__*__ we continue to expect profits to be in line with our expectations at the time of the July Interim Management Statement. Value added food and industrial ingredients again performed well achieving both volume and margin gains. We benefited from the expansion of our Sagamore__*__ Indiana value added plant. Liquid sweeteners continued to benefit from the modest margin improvements achieved in the 2008 calendar year pricing round.</p><p>As stated in July__*__ we are incurring some additional costs in commissioning patented new technology at the Loudon__*__ Tennessee corn wet mill. As we ramp-up our increased capacity__*__ we are pleased with the cost improvements demonstrated by this new technology__*__ which will have long-term economic and environmental benefits for this plant. Achieving full output__*__ however__*__ is taking longer than anticipated and the plant is currently running at 75% of targeted capacity. Some additional equipment has been ordered which__*__ when installed in October 2008 and March 2009__*__ should lead to output levels reaching 85% during the third quarter and 100% by the end of the financial year__*__ respectively. The profit impact in the first half year is expected to be £15 million__*__ which has been largely offset by improved profits elsewhere__*__ particularly in by-product returns. At current corn prices__*__ a further £10 million to £15 million of profit impact is expected during the second half of the financial year. </p><p>Construction of the new corn wet mill in Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa is progressing satisfactorily and the experience we have gained in working with the new technology at Loudon increases our confidence that this new plant will meet its targets.</p><p>The corn price has fallen to below US$5.50 per bushel from highs in June of almost US$8 per bushel__*__ but it is still around a third higher than this time last year. It remains volatile given recent weather conditions in the USA. Current corn prices have improved industry fundamentals for the forthcoming US 2009 calendar year sweetener pricing round__*__ although this has reduced the overall improvement in by-product returns that was captured in the first quarter. </p><p>At our Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe division__*__ the corn wet milling operations benefited from improved co-product returns and falling corn costs__*__ although the average net corn cost was higher than in the corresponding prior year period. The Food Systems businesses (Hahn and Cesalpinia) continued to perform well.</p><p>All EU sugar businesses__*__ as widely reported__*__ continue to operate in a very difficult market while surplus stock is absorbed against a backdrop of reducing institutional prices. Gas prices at our UK refinery have continued to be higher than expected. We remain confident that__*__ during the second half of the year__*__ market equilibrium between supply and demand for EU sugar will be restored__*__ which should lead to progressively firmer refining margins. The molasses business is again performing strongly__*__ experiencing strong demand from customers despite lower EU cereal prices.</p><p>Sucralose sales volume growth has continued to be strong and consistent with our longer-term capacity utilisation target. Sales values increased at a lower rate primarily due to changes in sales mix. As previously highlighted__*__ the results will include the incremental impact of a first full six months of costs associated with the Singapore facility__*__ which was commissioned in June 2007. Looking forward__*__ there are indications that the current economic climate is having an impact on the number of FMCG product launches__*__ particularly in the USA. </p><p>The preliminary non-binding decision by the administrative law judge in our patent infringement action in the US International Trade Commission (ITC) is expected on 22 September 2008__*__ with the subsequent review and formal decision by the full ITC within four months of the judge’s decision.</p><p>NET DEBT</p><p>Net debt at the end of August 2008 was £1__*__149 million compared with £1__*__041 million at 31 March 2008. The effect of movements in exchange rates since 31 March 2008 was to increase net debt by around £75 million.</p><p>OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2009</p><p>As we stated in July the general deterioration in global economic conditions coupled with the increased volatility in commodity prices__*__ energy costs__*__ and exchange rates make any statement about the outlook more than usually difficult. Nevertheless the Board is confident that the Group currently remains on track to make progress for the year as a whole. The adverse impact from the commissioning of new technology at Loudon should be largely offset by improved profits elsewhere and by beneficial exchange rate movements (note 1).</p><p>Note 1: we assume a £:US$ exchange rate of 1.85 in translating profits for the balance of the year</p><p><b>END</b></p><p><br/></p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8.00am BST__*__ hosted by Iain Ferguson__*__ Chief Executive and Tim Lodge__*__ Director of Investor Relations.

Tate & Lyle’s new American market research finds that nearly 50 percent of consumers now believe fiber can taste good and many are looking for benefits beyond regularity.
</p><p>Dietary fiber isn’t a new nutrient. Its application in food and beverages__*__ however__*__ is relatively novel. Over the past two years__*__ 65 percent of consumers report having a greater interest in healthy eating.

</p><p>- Fifty-five percent of consumers find the benefit of “supports a healthy immune system” appealing on labels for bottled water

817,auto,Legacy Import,1/28/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC Interim Management Statement,"<p>Tate & Lyle PLC issues the following management statement covering the period from 1 October 2008 to 31 December 2008.
</p><p>OVERVIEW
</p><p>The 2009 calendar year sweetener pricing round in the US has concluded satisfactorily__*__ with price increases anticipated to recover higher net corn costs.
</p><p>The global economy has continued to deteriorate since we reported our Interim Results on 6 November 2008__*__ particularly in the US where results at our US Ingredients business were held back by significant customer de-stocking in November and December. Reductions in US gasoline consumption__*__ together with a higher relative fall in the oil price than the corn price__*__ also impacted ethanol demand and margins. 
</p><p>Results at our European Ingredients__*__ Sugars and Sucralose businesses were together broadly in line with our expectations.
</p><p>Significant movements in foreign exchange rates benefited the translation of profits earned in foreign currencies__*__ but also had an adverse direct and indirect impact on our export markets. 
</p><p>In the first weeks of January 2009 we have seen signs that customer de-stocking may be coming to an end. However__*__ orders remain at lower levels than in the first half of the financial year and we now expect the outturn for the Group’s continuing operations in the year to 31 March 2009 to be broadly in line with the lower end of market expectations__*__ which approximates to the outturn for the prior year. (notes 1 and 2)
</p><p>Our focus on the food sector gives us a measure of resilience__*__ although not immunity__*__ to the current conditions in the global economy. We are a well-financed business and are confident of our ability to deliver positive cash flows and weather the prevailing economic storms.
</p><p>TRADING PERFORMANCE
</p><p>In the <b>Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas</b> division__*__ the difficult economic conditions led to significant de-stocking by customers__*__ although in the first weeks of January 2009 we have seen signs that this de-stocking may now be coming to an end. As expected__*__ costs were higher as we incurred additional costs in commissioning patented new technology at the Loudon__*__ Tennessee corn wet mill. The strong US dollar__*__ while benefiting the translation of profit into sterling__*__ directly and indirectly affected demand. Exports of HFCS into Mexico became less competitive against local sugar as a result of the Mexican peso’s devaluation of around 30%. In addition to reduced local demand__*__ exports from the US paper industry__*__ which is the main customer for our industrial starches__*__ reduced as the strong US dollar undermined its competitiveness in the global market.
</p><p>Oil prices fell from their highs of the summer__*__ leading to much lower ethanol prices. Corn prices also fell but not to the same relative extent__*__ resulting in low ethanol contribution margins__*__ even for wet mill producers. With a number of dry mill ethanol producers operating within Chapter 11 bankruptcy__*__ and reduced consumption of US gasoline__*__ ethanol margins are likely to remain under pressure in the short term. Looking forward__*__ ethanol margins should be supported by the Renewable Fuel Standard.
</p><p>Energy prices are hedged in advance and there will be minimal impact from lower fuel costs in the remainder of the financial year.
</p><p>At our Loudon__*__ Tennessee plant__*__ the second tranche of equipment required to meet design capacity will shortly be installed. During installation we will also take the opportunity to re-engineer the plant’s manufacturing footprint to provide additional flexibility to swing capacity between key product lines. This is one of several initiatives to increase our operational flexibility in response to the current economic climate. The new corn wet mill in Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa will be substantially complete by the end of March 2009. 
</p><p>Lower net corn costs benefited <b>Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe</b>. There was good demand for food ingredients and HFCS (isoglucose) but there was reduced demand for industrial starches for use in paper and board. The Food Systems business continued to perform in line with our expectations.
</p><p>Energy costs were higher at our corn wet mills. The interrupted gas supply from Russia affected our Central and Eastern EU plants during January. However__*__ there was no major disruption in supplying our customers’ needs and the profit impact was not material.
</p><p>The small HFCS quota in the Netherlands was surrendered on 1 October 2008 and restructuring aid of €7 million (£5 million) was booked as operating profit during the period.
</p><p>Within the <b>Sugars</b> division__*__ our EU sugar refineries benefited from the lower institutional raw sugar prices from 1 October 2008__*__ which reduced as part of the reform of the EU sugar regime. The market__*__ particularly UK retail__*__ remains extremely competitive__*__ and the profit improvement until the next institutional price change on October 1 2009 is expected to be small. The construction of the new biomass boiler__*__ which is able to replace up to 70% of current gas consumption at the UK refinery__*__ is nearing completion on time and will be commissioned in the new financial year. In addition to the benefits of generating energy from biomass__*__ falling gas prices will also reduce costs once current contracts expire. Molasses has continued its strong performance.
</p><p><b>Sucralose</b> volumes increased by 6% over the comparative period in the prior year. Sales values were lower in constant currency__*__ but margins remained stable. Although the rate of innovation by our customers has been variable__*__ the number of new product launches increased over the comparative period. We are also encouraged by progress in improving manufacturing yields as we implement process developments identified at our pilot plant. Our petition to appeal the preliminary__*__ non-binding decision in our International Trade Commission (ITC) litigation against a number of Chinese manufacturers and distributors concerning alleged infringement of certain of our patents was accepted. The ITC indicated that it would now publish its binding decision on 23 February 2009__*__ a postponement from the previous indication of publication on 21 January 2009.
</p><p><b>Central</b> costs<b> </b>decreased as we benefited from last year’s management reorganisation and other cost reductions. There was an improved performance at our captive reinsurance company.
</p><p>DEBT
</p><p>Net debt at 31 December 2008 was £1__*__530 million. The effect of exchange translation since 30 September 2008 was to increase reported net debt by £267 million and accounted for much of the £402 million increase over the period. There were higher variation margin calls in respect of corn positions for contracted business__*__ primarily in the US__*__ which accounted for the majority of the operational outflow in the period.
</p><p>Undrawn committed bank facilities were US$437 million (£300 million) at 31 December 2008 and__*__ in addition__*__ the Group’s cash resources totalled £281 million. Since September 2008 we have arranged a further committed bank facility of US$45 million and various other facilities to manage working capital movements__*__ in particular to mitigate partially the impact of corn price fluctuations. Average gross debt maturity at 31 December 2008 was 4.7 years and the first major refinancing will be the US$300 million 144A bond maturing in June 2011. 
</p><p>Based on current corn prices we expect our net debt at 31 March 2009 to be similar to the net debt at 31 March 2008 once it has been adjusted for movements in exchange rates. (note 3) 
</p><p>We had set a target for capital expenditure of a maximum of 1.25 times the depreciation charge from the end of the current financial year when the current major capital projects will have been completed. Following a review of our short term capital plans__*__ we now expect capital expenditure to be a maximum of 1.0 times the depreciation charge for the year ending 31 March 2010.
</p><p>OUTLOOK
</p><p>The persistent economic downturn and its uncertain impact on customer demand continues to make any comment about the outlook difficult. 
</p><p>We are pleased that__*__ against the backdrop of a volatile and challenging market__*__ we have been able to complete the annual sweetener pricing round in the US satisfactorily. Since the beginning of the 2009 calendar year we have seen signs that the significant customer de-stocking which occurred in November and December may be coming to an end. 
</p><p>Our short term focus is on the active management of our cost base and on maximising cash flow. We are making good progress in both these areas. Based on current corn prices we expect our net debt at 31 March 2009 to be similar to the net debt at 31 March 2008 once it has been adjusted for movements in exchange rates. (note 3)
</p><p>Overall__*__ based upon our current expectations for market conditions in the final quarter of the year and with the currency benefit of the strengthening US dollar__*__ we now expect the outturn for the Group’s continuing operations in the year to 31 March 2009 to be broadly in line with the lower end of market expectations__*__ which approximates to the outturn for the prior year. (notes 1 & 2)
</p><p>Our focus on the food sector gives us a measure of resilience__*__ although not immunity__*__ to the current conditions in the global economy. We are a well-financed business and are confident of our ability to deliver positive cash flows and weather the prevailing economic storms.
</p><p>Note 1: for any comments on profits for the year to 31 March 2009__*__ it has been assumed that the period end and average exchange rates for the last quarter of the year ending 31 March 2009 are £1 = US$1.45 = €1.1.
</p><p>Note 2: The profit before tax for the continuing operations__*__ adjusted to exclude exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets for the year ended 31 March 2008 and restated to exclude the results of international sugar trading__*__ whose disposal was announced on 2 July 2008__*__ was £253 million.
</p><p>Note 3: the reported net debt of £1__*__041 million at 31 March 2008__*__ re-translated at the year-end exchange rates at 31 March 2009 assumed above__*__ would have been approximately £1__*__400 million.

818,auto,Legacy Import,2/2/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Releases New Consumer Dietary Fibre Research Findings,"<p><b>Health conscious consumers want good-tasting fibre-rich products… and they are ready to pay more!</b>
</p><p><b>Tate & Lyle Releases New Consumer Dietary Fibre Research Findings </b>
</p><p>New research released by Tate & Lyle today has revealed that the explosion of consumer interest in Health and Wellness in recent years shows no sign of abating. Consistent with results from previous studies__*__ 91 percent of the 4050 consumers surveyed consider themselves to be in good health__*__ although more than before they believe they are overweight. As a result__*__ 64 percent of consumers questioned said they had shown a greater interest in eating healthily over the past two years.
</p><p><b>Consumers Want Healthy Food and Beverages …</b>
</p><p>The increased interest in Health and Wellness was reflected in consumers’ views on labelling with a majority saying that they are reading labels when choosing foods and drinks to decide whether they are making a healthy choice. 72 percent of parents also claim to be paying more attention to the ingredients used in products for their children.
</p><p>The findings also confirm a growing awareness of the importance of fibre. Most respondents are clearly looking for added benefits such as digestive health and weight management__*__ while over two thirds of parents believe that fibre is an important part of their child’s diet.
</p><p><b>… and Good Taste! </b>
</p><p>Commenting on the survey findings__*__ Jerome Tauzin__*__ Tate & Lyle’s Product Manager__*__ Fibre__*__ Europe__*__ Middle East and Africa__*__ said: “One way that companies can meet the demand for healthy products is by boosting fibre content in foods and beverages. Although 40 percent of respondents are still worried that higher fibre content could alter the taste of products__*__ Tate & Lyle’s Dietary fibres range has been shown to provide products with great taste.” 
</p><p>“The really good news is that Tate & Lyle has shown that half of the European consumers surveyed are willing to pay more for a product with a fibre claim on-pack across all categories__*__ from Baked Goods__*__ to Dairy and Beverages. This is especially good since the study was conducted during a period when the economy was already under pressure”.
</p><p>Tate & Lyle’s new consumer research provides important insight on how to communicate with consumers about higher fibre content products and highlights appealing label statements for consumers. “Consumers want simple__*__ concise labels which clearly show a product’s health benefits__*__ to make shopping decisions easier” explained Jerome Tauzin. “For instance__*__ a claim about ’digestive health’ for beverages received top score in all countries”.
</p><p>Tate & Lyle is working with its customers to provide products both with a higher fibre content and great taste and functionality. In September 2008__*__ Tate & Lyle also announced its intention to open Europe’s first Polydextrose fibre production line in 2009__*__ at the same time as it opened its new innovation centre in Lille__*__ France.

823,auto,Legacy Import,2/17/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Identifies the Top 7 Food and Beverage Trends in the U.S.,"<p><b>Decatur</b><b>__*__ Ill.</b><b> (Feb. 17__*__ 2009) - </b>Dubbed the “Year of Change__*__” 2009 is ushering in increased consumer attraction to foods and beverages with multiple health benefits. With economic uncertainty influencing consumer purchasing decisions and interest in healthy eating on the rise__*__ food and beverage manufacturers can feed consumer demand for products that provide more bang for the buck. Tate & Lyle spoke with several food and beverage manufacturers and spotted seven food trends that U.S. consumers are eating up this year. 
</p><p><b>Trend 1: Reduced Calories: </b>The Mayo Clinic advises consumers to reduce calories through portion control and eating lower calorie foods. As such__*__ food and beverages that reduce sugar and calorie content without compromising taste have an excellent chance of getting into consumers’ homes. This can be achieved by creating custom blends with sweeteners such as KRYSTAR® Crystalline Fructose or SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ a zero calorie sweetener. 
</p><p><b>Trend 2: Health & Wellness: </b>Consumers want food and beverage products that support their healthy lifestyles. Tate & Lyle’s 2008 U.S. market research found that consumers prefer products with functional health benefits including digestive health__*__ immunity defense and weight management. Hot health and wellness ingredients in 2009: Dietary fiber__*__ vitamins and protein.
</p><p><b>Trend 3: Budget Management. </b>With the economy in a downturn__*__ it’s no surprise U.S. consumers are tightening their belts. Food and beverage manufacturers can help them save cash by partnering with suppliers on sweetener or texturant optimization processes that could lead to significant production savings__*__ which can be passed on to consumers__*__ while delivering a final product with an improved health profile. 
</p><p><b>Trend 4: Functional Ingredients: </b>Food isn’t just what’s on the plate. The added value of the ingredients used in products has gained a starring role. In January 2009__*__ The Chicago Tribune reported that consumers are seeking foods that deliver benefits against multiple conditions__*__ such as added-fiber products promoting digestive health and appetite-curbing benefits.
</p><p><b>Trend 5: Comfort Foods. </b>Many foodies are saying farewell to nightly dining at restaurants in favor of preparing meals at home. In December 2008__*__ The Houston Chronicle reported that consumers are going back to foods that are reminiscent of their childhood. 
</p><p><b>Trend 6: Simple Ingredients__*__ Clean Labels. </b>The International Food Information Council (IFIC) reported in its 2008 Health and Wellness survey that 51 percent of consumers look at ingredients on the label when determining what to purchase and eat. The report also indicated that 52 percent of consumers are looking for fiber and 40 percent are seeking protein. Foods with functional__*__ recognizable ingredients__*__ such as dietary fiber__*__ on the label are in. Ingredients requiring an advanced degree in biochemistry to understand are out. 
</p><p><b>Trend 7: Healthy Indulgence. </b>Consumers want to have their “indulgent cake and eat it too.” Several reports indicate decadent foods with a healthy twist are sparking food interests. Consumers are seeking their favorite desserts__*__ like ice cream and cookies__*__ fortified with dietary fiber__*__ vitamins and other nutrients to enjoy without the residual guilt.

833,auto,Legacy Import,4/2/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC Trading Statement On Entering Closed Period,"<p>In line with our usual practice__*__ Tate & Lyle issues the following trading update for the year ended 31 March 2009 ahead of the announcement of the full year results on 28 May 2009.
</p><p>SUMMARY
</p><p>Profit before tax1 for the year to 31 March 2009 is expected to be marginally below our previous guidance of an outturn approximate to that of the prior year. However the mix of profits has reduced the tax rate so earnings per share are expected to be broadly in line with market expectations.
</p><p>Solid progress has been made on debt reduction. Net debt at 31 March 2009 was less than £1.25 billion__*__ around £300 million less than at 31 December 2008__*__ and more than £150 million lower than net debt at 31 March 2008 once it has been adjusted for the effects of movements in exchange rates.
</p><p>TRADING PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 31 MARCH 2009
</p><p>Results at <b>Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas</b> improved over the previous quarter as orders from most food and beverage customers began to return towards more normal levels. However__*__ demand for sweeteners and industrial starches remained weak. Ethanol margins and volumes continued to be under severe pressure. As anticipated__*__ we completed a sale of land in Mexico and have taken £3 million to profit.
</p><p><b>Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe</b> continued to perform well. The Single Ingredients business benefited from lower net corn costs__*__ despite experiencing pressure on industrial starch volumes. The Food Systems business continued to trade in line with our expectations. Following the closure of the Greek factory__*__ as anticipated we have taken £4 million Restructuring Aid to profit. 
</p><p>In the <b>Sugars</b> division__*__ the UK retail market remained extremely competitive. We continue to be encouraged by the significant progress of the EU Sugar Regime reforms__*__ which have now achieved the majority of the agreed target reduction in production quotas. However__*__ the profit performance of the division until the next institutional price change on 1 October 2009 is expected to be modest. 
</p><p><b>Sucralose</b> volumes and profits increased over the previous quarter although they were lower than a strong quarter in the comparative prior year period. We continue to be encouraged by the considerable progress we are making in improving manufacturing yields as we implement process developments identified at our pilot plant. The International Trade Commission (ITC) has further postponed to 3 April 2009 the publication of its binding decision in relation to litigation against a number of Chinese manufacturers and distributors concerning alleged infringement of certain of our patents. 
</p><p>Exchange rates have been relatively stable in the quarter__*__ and continued to benefit the translation of profits earned in foreign currencies when compared with the prior year.
</p><p>FORT DODGE
</p><p>Construction activities at the Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa plant have been progressing satisfactorily and are nearly complete.
</p><p>However__*__ given the continuing short term severe pressure on ethanol margins and volumes__*__ we have postponed final completion of the construction and start-up of the plant until market conditions improve. The situation will be kept under review. We continue to believe that the Renewable Fuels Standard underpins the long term viability of ethanol. 
</p><p>TAXATION
</p><p>The effective tax rate for the continuing operations for the year to 31 March 2009 is now expected to fall below our expectations of 30.4% as stated at the half-year results and to be around 28%. This reduction is due to change in the geographic mix of profits__*__ in particular the higher proportion of non-US earnings.
</p><p>EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
</p><p>During March we received the first tranche of a cash settlement in respect of a dispute with the Mexican government over a tax on soft drinks containing HFCS between 2002 and 2006 and we expect to receive the second payment in the coming months. Our share of the total settlement is £10 million and this will be treated as an exceptional profit. At Food & Industrial Ingredients__*__ Americas__*__ we are in dispute with a supplier over the performance and suitability of certain equipment it has supplied. As a prudent measure__*__ we expect to take a £24 million exceptional write-down relating to this issue in the year to 31 March 2009. 
</p><p>DISPOSAL OF INTERNATIONAL SUGAR TRADING
</p><p>The disposal of the international sugar trading business to Bunge__*__ announced on 2 July 2008__*__ was completed as scheduled on 31 March 2009. At completion__*__ Bunge took over the remaining working capital of the disposed business__*__ resulting in a total cash inflow of US$81 million (£56 million)__*__ subject to closing adjustments. 
</p><p>DEBT 
</p><p>Management remains focused on strong cash management and has taken a significant number of actions to reduce costs__*__ optimise working capital and reduce capital expenditure. 
</p><p>We indicated in our Interim Management Statement on 28 January 2009 that we expected net debt at 31 March 2009 to be similar to the net debt at 31 March 2008 once it had been adjusted for movements in exchange rates. Solid progress has been made in the last quarter and net debt at 31 March 2009 was less than £1.25 billion. This is around £300 million less than at 31 December 2008__*__ and more than £150 million lower than net debt at 31 March 2008 once it has been adjusted for the effects of movements in exchange rates.
</p><p>Undrawn committed bank facilities were US$752 million (£526 million) at 31 March 2009 and__*__ in addition__*__ the Group’s cash resources were more than £350 million. Average gross debt maturity at 31 March 2009 was 4.9 years and the first major refinancing will be the US$300 million 144A bond maturing in June 2011. 
</p><p>IAIN FERGUSON__*__ CHIEF EXECUTIVE__*__ COMMENTS:
</p><p>“In the face of the economic downturn and its uncertain impact on customer demand__*__ we continue to focus on matters under our control__*__ in particular through the active management of our cost base and by maximising cash flow. Through these actions we have made solid progress in reducing our debt which at the end of the financial year was lower than our previous expectations. We remain a well-financed business and confident of our ability to deliver positive cash flows.”

849,auto,Legacy Import,6/22/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Reduces Its Footprint With The Carbon Trust,"<p>Tate & Lyle has announced today that the carbon footprint of its retail cane sugar is 380 grams of CO2 per 1 kilogram bag. Tate & Lyle sugar will carry the Carbon Reduction Label later in the year. 
</p><p>A 12 month project__*__ using the PAS 2050 methodology and the Carbon Trust’s Footprint Expert tool__*__ measured the carbon footprint for Tate & Lyle’s UK cane sugar refining business from the sugar cane field__*__ to supermarket shelf__*__ to consumer consumption and waste disposal. The project also calculated the carbon footprint of bulk granulated sugar for supply to industrial customers at 300 grammes CO2 per 1kg.
</p><p>Raw cane sugar milling is almost carbon neutral. Cane grows in the field__*__ waste fibre from the cane powers the factory and the cane re-grows each year__*__ often up to 10 times without the need for replanting. It is then transported by Tate & Lyle to its UK refinery by ship; widely regarded as the most energy efficient mode of transport only producing very small levels of CO2 emissions per tonne shipped.
</p><p>The company committed to measure and reduce its carbon footprint in December 2007__*__ when it also announced plans for a new biomass boiler at its Thames site. The new biomass boiler__*__ which is currently being commissioned__*__ will provide Tate & Lyle with 70% of its energy needs at the London refinery allowing the company to reduce its use of fossil fuels. 
</p><p>Simon Houghton-Dodd__*__ Head of Quality and Sustainability at Tate and Lyle Sugars said: “We have received a great deal of interest in our carbon footprint from customers. It is great that we can demonstrate that because of the methods used in sugar cane farming__*__ milling and refining__*__ although it is grown so far away__*__ Tate & Lyle cane sugar has a very low carbon footprint; there is no conflict between choosing to support trade with developing countries and seeking to minimise your carbon footprint.""
</p><p>Euan Murray__*__ General Manager Carbon Footprinting__*__ Carbon Trust said: “Tate & Lyle’s project shows that ‘food miles’ should not be the main consideration for consumers who are trying to buy green. The Carbon Trust’s rigorous and independent certification process shows that products that source raw materials from developing countries like Belize and Ghana__*__ don’t necessarily have higher footprints. 
</p><p>Consumers repeatedly tell us that they want to be able to make informed climate friendly choices when they shop. Seeing our Carbon Reduction Label on basics like sugar lets them know that Tate & Lyle is committed to reducing the carbon footprint across the supply chain of that product. The Carbon Trust congratulates Tate & Lyle for taking on this project and for their commitment to reduce carbon emissions and tackle climate change.”
</p><p><b>Notes to editors </b>
</p><p>Tate & Lyle has an overall target to reduce energy consumption by 3% per annum and this has been in place since 2000. In addition__*__ the company is a net-exporter to the National Grid from its London refinery.

</p><p>· The Carbon Trust is the leading international organisation helping companies measure__*__ reduce and communicate the carbon footprints of their products and services. The carbon footprint of a product or service is the total carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases emitted during its life__*__ from production to final disposal. 
</p><p>· The Carbon Trust and Defra co-sponsored the development of PAS 2050 by BSI British Standards__*__ published in October 2008. The PAS 2050 is the first international standard for companies to measure the carbon footprint of their products and services. 
</p><p>· In 2007__*__ The Carbon Trust also launched the Carbon Reduction Label to help companies communicate the impact of their product carbon footprinting work to consumers. Companies that display the Carbon Trust’s Carbon Reduction Label (on pack__*__ online or elsewhere) are making a commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of their product or service. 
</p><p>· The Carbon Trust has worked with companies on more than 65 product carbon footprinting projects and 3__*__000 individual product lines.

853,auto,Legacy Import,7/9/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle Consumer Research Discovers the Top 5 Facts about Fiber,"<p><b>Decatur</b><b>__*__ Ill.</b> (July 9__*__ 2009) – Fiber is fiber. 
</p><p>The key is to let consumers know that fiber is in their favorite foods and beverages. Tate & Lyle’s research found that consumers want healthier fare and believe fiber can help them reach their healthy living goals. 
</p><p>Many long-held misconceptions about fiber still exist. Here are five facts straight from consumers that Tate & Lyle found in its U.S. market research. 
</p><p><b>No. 1: Simple__*__ Label-Friendly Terminology:</b> When it comes to consumer understanding__*__ promoting monikers such as insoluble fiber__*__ soluble fiber and functional fiber with virtually no consumer education earn failing grades. In fact__*__ research shows that less than 10 percent of consumers are familiar with each of these terms. On the other hand__*__ consumers seem to have a greater affinity for simple terms – 75 percent are familiar with whole grains__*__ 65 percent are familiar with fiber and 44 percent are familiar with dietary fiber. 
</p><p><b>No. 2: Whole Grains are Misleading: </b>A great deal of confusion surrounds whole grains. Research found that more than half of consumers (55 percent) say the more whole grains in their food__*__ the more fiber it contains. When they find out whole grains and fiber are not the same__*__ consumers report feeling misled. Specifying fiber content on packages may help manufacturers continually build brand-loyalty while maintaining credibility.
</p><p><b>No. 3: On-Pack Information Helps Sales:</b> Ingredient information__*__ particularly about fiber__*__ on packages has been shown to positively influence consumer purchases. The company’s research found that nearly 50 percent of consumers trust on-pack information about fiber. That’s more than they trust friends__*__ the Internet__*__ in-store information__*__ word-of-mouth or manufacturers ads. Information Resources Institute (IRI) found that another 60 percent like the idea of placing healthy product indicators on packages. The bottom line: To help gain a bigger share of your category__*__ the front package is prime real estate. Using it may help convert dietary fiber and health information into cash for your company.
</p><p><b>No. 4: Taste is an Opportunity: </b>It’s no secret. Great-tasting food and beverages maintain loyal followers. With 57 percent of consumers seeking healthier products these days__*__ manufacturers integrating good taste with health benefits may see a boost in the health of their bottom lines. In fact__*__ nearly 50 percent of consumers believe fiber-rich food and drinks can taste good. 
</p><p><b>No. 5: Fiber Means Healthy Digestion: </b>Seventy-nine percent of consumers agree – maintaining digestive health is directly related to including fiber in their diets. And__*__ 52 percent of consumers believe healthy digestion is the most important reason to add fiber to their diets. Consumers believe other benefits exist as well. Fifty-three percent agree that weight is affected by fiber intake and another 35 perfect say fiber helps support a healthy immune system.

857,auto,Legacy Import,8/25/2009,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Consumer Confessions: I Look for Dietary Fiber Content on Food & Drink Labels,"<p><b>Decatur</b><b>__*__ Ill.</b><b> (August 25__*__ 2009)</b> – Consumers’ secrets are out: When shopping for themselves and their loved ones__*__ they are swayed by what’s prominently displayed on food labels.
</p><p>As U.S. consumers actively embrace healthier lifestyles__*__ Tate & Lyle found that 55 percent of them display a laser-like focus on nutrition facts and ingredient labels. 
</p><p>“As a leading ingredient company in the U.S.__*__ Tate & Lyle is committed to understanding consumers’ needs as they start and maintain healthy lifestyles__*__” says David Lewis__*__ Business Manager__*__ PROMITOR™ Dietary Fiber__*__ Tate & Lyle. “With consumers pressed for time__*__ food labels quickly communicate nutrition information to help them choose products that support their healthy intentions.”
</p><p><b>8 Approaches to Label Reading</b>
</p><p>From blogs and online forums to news reports and diet trends__*__ today’s time-crunched consumers are inundated with messages about healthy dining from multiple sources. Consumers shared eight approaches to label reading with Tate & Lyle that help them determine which food and beverage items make the final cut.
</p><p><b>No. 1:</b> <b>Is it a New Product? </b>Many consumers are brand loyal and will scrutinize the labels of new products to determine if trial is necessary.
</p><p><b>No. 2:</b> <b>Who is it for? </b>Adult consumers aren’t the only one’s trending more toward healthier eating. Parents are exhibiting increased interest in reading labels if food and beverages are for their children.
</p><p><b>No. 3:</b> <b>Everyday or Indulgent Item? </b>Consumers are more diligent about reading packages of everyday staples. They also report having an interest in healthy indulgence.
</p><p><b>No. 4: Current Media Reports. </b>Consumers are more inclined to read labels if they read or watch diet and nutrition feature stories by key media influencers like Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Oz.
</p><p><b>No. 5: Influence of a Prior Diet Program. </b>Former dieters have learned to look for carbs and fiber from diets like Atkins and Weight Watchers.
</p><p><b>No. 6: Front Package Claims. </b>When specific health claims are made on the front of packages__*__ consumers tend to scrutinize the back and side panels of packages for additional information.
</p><p><b>No. 7: On a Diet. </b>Consumers focus on the most important aspects of the package that are dictated by the diet they are currently following.
</p><p><b>No. 8: In a Hurry. </b>Consumers__*__ especially parents__*__ are time-crunched and tend to read labels quickly to stay on schedule.
</p><p><b>Ingredients Matter</b>
</p><p>Many times__*__ consumer education starts and ends with packaging__*__ says Lisa Sanders__*__ Ph.D.__*__ R.D.__*__ Nutrition Scientist__*__ Tate & Lyle. With thousands of consumer brands flooding supermarket shelves__*__ the majority of consumers report two major reasons for reading labels.
</p><p>“Consumers want to make healthy choices and more than 60 percent of them rely on food and beverage labels to do this__*__” Dr. Sanders explains. “Research also shows that 50 percent of consumers look to labels when they are purposely trying to add specific nutrients__*__ like fiber__*__ to their diets.” 
</p><p>When reading labels__*__ the Nutrition Facts Panel is one of the top areas consumers read. Tate & Lyle found that 46 percent review the Nutrition Facts Panel to find out about fiber content. 
</p><p><b>Fiber is Excellent!</b>
</p><p>The International Food Information Council (IFIC) Foundation found that 43 percent of consumers look to product labels for statements about nutrition benefits. Tate & Lyle’s research reveals that 42 percent of consumers actively shop for foods and drinks that clearly indicate fiber on the package. 
</p><p>It’s a bonus if product labels tout an “excellent source of fiber*” statement on the front of the package. Consumers agree this statement is appealing to them across many product categories:
</p><p>- More than 60 percent (63 percent) of consumers find an “excellent source of fiber” on dairy products appealing
</p><p>- Seven in 10 (70 percent) of consumers believe cereals with an “excellent source of fiber” label claim is appealing
</p><p>- More than 50 percent (54 percent) of consumers say drink products with “excellent source of fiber” is appealing
</p><p>- Nearly 6 in 10 (59 percent) of consumers say bread products with “excellent source of fiber” is appealing

As previously indicated__*__ interest expense is expected to be above the level of the comparative period due to an increase in the pension charge and the suspension of capitalisation of interest at Fort Dodge.

Our citric acid business has also performed well. </p><p>Overall__*__ we continue to expect profits to be below the level of the comparative period due to lower co-product income and lower profits from industrial ingredients. Industrial starch volumes have been below the level of the prior year__*__ reflecting both lower levels of underlying demand from paper and packaging customers and additional demand in the comparative period following the floods in Iowa during 2008 which affected production at competitor plants. The underlying contribution from ethanol for the six months will be below the level of the comparative period__*__ due to lower unit margins__*__ although the comparison will benefit from additional costs in the comparative period associated with the commissioning of the Loudon capacity expansion. </p><p>We are pleased with the environmental benefits we have realized at our Loudon plant following the installation of new technology last year. This technology has also allowed us to obtain some benefits through process yield improvements although below the level originally targeted. However__*__ changes in energy and co-product pricing over the last two years have limited the benefits of the investment in energy cost reduction in today’s markets__*__ particularly since US gas prices have fallen significantly. Using our experiences at Loudon to date__*__ we continue to evaluate the extent to which this technology can be used effectively within our plant network__*__ including at our new plant in Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa. </p><p>The corn price has fallen almost to $3.00 per bushel during the last month following forecasts of a large 2009 corn crop. This has reduced co-product prices__*__ which also remain under pressure due both to lower demand__*__ following reductions in US beef and dairy herds__*__ and an increased supply of the by-product of dry mill ethanol production. </p><p><b>Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe</b> </p><p>Our Food &amp; Industrial Ingredients__*__ Europe division has performed above the level of the prior year due to the benefit of lower net corn costs__*__ but modestly below our expectations. </p><p><b>Sugars</b> </p><p>Sugars has continued to perform marginally ahead of our expectations although our EU Sugar refining business continued to experience the tough market conditions seen during the second half of the 2009 financial year. </p><p><b>Sucralose</b> </p><p>Sucralose has achieved double-digit volume and single-digit revenue growth over the comparative period__*__ reflecting both underlying demand and customer restocking. As our customer incentive plans generate volume__*__ average selling prices will trend lower. The mothballing of the McIntosh__*__ Alabama plant is proceeding ahead of schedule__*__ accelerating the benefits from lower cost production and we have achieved operating margins somewhat above our previous expectations. The Alabama plant is now being maintained in a state whereby it can be restarted within a few months. </p><p>OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2010 </p><p>We continue to be encouraged by the resilient demand levels experienced within food and beverage markets. With improved fundamentals for HFCS exports to Mexico__*__ and a modest contribution margin returning to spot US ethanol markets__*__ US sweetener supply and demand dynamics have tightened. </p><p>Initial forecasts indicate that corn harvests in both the US and Europe will be good. We expect continued soft corn co-product prices in the US and that industrial starch markets in both the EU and US will remain competitive. Whilst spot US ethanol selling prices currently generate a modest cash margin__*__ forward margins continue to be under pressure. Given the continuing lack of clear forward visibility in the industrial starch__*__ co-product and ethanol markets__*__ we have not yet determined the timing for the final completion of our Fort Dodge__*__ Iowa plant. </p><p>With the majority of sugar sales for the period to 30 September 2010 now contracted with customers__*__ we are increasingly confident of achieving improved margins within our EU Sugar business following the final institutional price change on 1 October 2009. </p><p>During the second half of the 2010 financial year__*__ we expect a continuation of growth in Sucralose driven by geographic expansion and our long-term customer contracts. </p><p>We are encouraged by our overall trading and financial performance in the year to date__*__ although a number of our markets remain challenging. </p><p>Note: we assume a £:US$ exchange rate of 1.68 in translating profits for the balance of the 2010 year </p><p><b>END</b> </p><p><a href=""https://www.tateandlyle.presscentre.com/backstage/contentmanagement/otherareas/releaseUI.asp?NewsAreaID=2&amp;ReleaseID=863&amp;ClientID=1&amp;LocaleID=2#_ftnref1"" target=""_blank"">[1]</a> Corn prices in the US saw an unprecedented spike in the 2008 calendar year__*__ reaching almost US$8 per bushel in July 2008.

Americans are anxiously defining and refining their New Year’s resolutions__*__ sorting through the medley of healthy eating advice and carefully scrutinizing each brand found at their favorite supermarkets. Tate &amp; Lyle identifies four key consumer-driven trends impacting brand transition from store shelves to consumer cupboards in 2010.  </p><p><b>Trend 1: Private Label Upgrade </b></p><p>Formerly considered the generic step sister of national brands__*__ private label products are stepping into the spotlight with innovative premium options that are competing for long-term share of wallet. </p><p>Mintel’s Feb. 2008 “Private Label Foods” study reports that 78 percent of U.S. adults say private label products offer the same quality at a lower price than their branded counterparts.

The study found that 95 percent of shoppers would buy green and 63 percent are looking for green. The study also identifies green consumers as routine__*__ weekly shoppers who are less sensitive to price and more likely to repurchase products once they’ve adopted them.  </p><p>As Americans become more sensitive to the impact of their choices on the environment__*__ they are displaying their social conscious by purchasing more environmentally responsible products.</p><p><i>Make it work for you: </i>Scrutinize the origin of your ingredients and use ingredients that are sourced from renewable crops like corn and cane sugar.

910,auto,Legacy Import,10/25/2010,Press releases,For Immediate Release,American citric acid industry challenges imports circumventing U.S. trade remedies,<p>On October 22__*__ 2010__*__ the American citric acid industry asked that the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) investigate possible “circumvention” of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on citric acid and certain citrate salts (citric acid products) from China. The target of this initial request is the transshipment of Chinese citric acid products through Thailand. </p><p>In May 2009__*__ AD and CVD orders were imposed on imports of citric acid products from China. These orders require importers of Chinese citric acid products to post CVD duties of between 3.60 and 118.95 percent__*__ and AD duties of between 94.61 and 156.87 percent. By transshipping the citric acid products and declaring the intermediate country as the country of origin__*__ Chinese producers and exporters avoid payments of these duties. These actions not only rob the U.S. Treasury of significant revenues__*__ but they also threaten the health of American citizens by rendering the source of an important food__*__ beverage__*__ and pharmaceutical ingredient untraceable. </p><p>At least one official of a major Chinese citric acid producer has made public statements confirming this practice. The July 2010 edition of <i>Corn Products China News </i>contains the following remarkable disclosure: </p><p>“In order to avoid anti-dumping duty and CVD in the US__*__ Chinese citric acid producers usually make use of overseas traders with no anti-dumping or CVD cases in the US to export citric acid to the US__*__ disclosed by Mr. Yuan__*__ Securities Consultant from Anhui BBCA Biochemical Co.__*__ Ltd. (Anhui BBCA)__*__ one of the leading citric acid producers in China.”</p><p>The request to investigate possible circumvention by Chinese citric acid products through Thailand is only the first of several possible anti-circumvention actions to be filed by the American citric acid industry. The U.S. producers continue actively to monitor and collect information on global Chinese shipments and are gathering evidence regarding possible transshipment of Chinese citric acid products through a number of other countries__*__ including Israel__*__ Indonesia__*__ India__*__ the Dominican Republic__*__ Japan__*__ Korea__*__ and Taiwan. In addition__*__ the U.S. citric acid industry is monitoring imports for possible product mislabeling__*__ including the practice of blending Chinese citric acid products with other ingredients in order to avoid duty payments. The industry is working closely with Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ensure that duties owed are collected on imports__*__ that any potentially illegal activities are investigated__*__ and that the integrity of the supply chain for this important food product is not compromised. </p><p><b>Ends</b></p><p>The U.S. citric acid industry consists of Archer Daniels Midland Company; Cargill__*__ Incorporated; and Tate &amp; Lyle Americas LLC. Collectively__*__ these companies employ hundreds of highly skilled workers in the states of Illinois__*__ Iowa__*__ Minnesota__*__ North Carolina__*__ and Ohio to produce and sell citric acid and citrate salts.

926,auto,Legacy Import,7/28/2004,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Update prior to the Annual General Meeting,<p>Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading update ahead of the Annual General Meeting of the Company that takes place at 11.30 am on 29th July 2004.<br /><br />Trading in the 2005 year has started well. Profit before tax and exceptional items for the quarter ended 30th June 2004 has been ahead of both our expectation and the corresponding period in the prior year. All major businesses have met or exceeded plan. Compared with the corresponding period__*__ the anticipated shortfall in Amylum's profitability has been more than offset by a better than expected contribution achieved by SPLENDA® Sucralose.<br /><br />Although it is early in the financial year the decline in raw material prices for Amylum and the success of SPLENDA® Sucralose makes it likely that the profit before tax and exceptional items for the year will be somewhat higher than the Board envisaged at the time of the preliminary announcement of results on 3rd June 2004.<br /><br />We announced earlier today that Staley has reached agreement to end the long running high fructose corn syrup civil legal case in the US with the payment of total damages of US$100 million (£55 million). This will result in an exceptional charge to the profit and loss account of this amount. As the payment is expected to be tax deductible in the US__*__ this equates to a charge of $60 million (£33 million) on an after tax basis. Staley continues to deny emphatically involvement in any wrongdoing__*__ but has settled with great reluctance to ensure an end to this lengthy action and to avoid the risk and uncertainty that a US jury trial would involve.<br /><br />The buyer of Western Sugar has refinanced and has accelerated repayment of our outstanding loan note which arose on disposal of Western in May 2002. This has resulted in cash proceeds to Tate &amp; Lyle of £22 million and an exceptional credit to the profit and loss account of £16 million.<br /><br />We are pleased with the progress being made on our strategy to grow value added products and__*__ in particular__*__ the success of SPLENDA® Sucralose. We announced earlier this year an expansion to the plant in McIntosh__*__ Alabama and today announce a further investment of £24 million (US$45 million). The investment will be funded from existing resources and will be completed by April 2006 by which time the output from the Alabama site will be more than double its level at the time of the realignment of the SPLENDA® Sucralose partnership.<br /><br />The commissioning of the astaxanthin plant to produce Aquasta™__*__ a natural nutrient and pigment for farm raised fish__*__ has also been completed and commercial sales have commenced. Construction of the new plant for the DuPont Tate &amp; Lyle BioProducts__*__ LLC joint venture to produce Bio-3G in Loudon__*__ Tennessee__*__ has commenced.<br /><br />The proposal on the reform of the EU sugar regime was tabled by the European Commission in the middle of July. What now follows will be wide-ranging discussions involving the industry__*__ farmers__*__ customers and national governments as well as the European institutions. We will be using this process to ensure that our interests and concerns are properly addressed and to evaluate fully the effect on our businesses. We are encouraged by recent support from the Environment__*__ Food &amp; Rural Affairs Select Committee investigating the issue which stated that:<br />“We agree with the Government that ways have to be found to ensure the cane refining sector is not put at an unfair disadvantage during an interim period when preferential suppliers are adapting to the reform.” The timetable for negotiations extends into 2005.</p>,

943,auto,Legacy Import,6/24/2011,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle’s CREAMIZ™ Wins Ringier 2011 Food & Beverage Technology Innovation Award,"<p><strong>Shanghai__*__ China</strong> (23 June 2011 ) - Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ the global ingredients and food solutions provider__*__ announced today that its newly launched starch CREAMIZ&trade; has won the 2011 Ringier Technology Innovation Award for best food &amp; beverage ingredient. This Food &amp; Beverage prize was awarded by Ringier Trade Publishing Company in recognition of the significant contribution of CREAMIZ&trade; to the advancement of the food and beverage industry in China.</p>
<p class=""a"">The award winners were selected by an independent panel__*__ comprising of a group of industry experts. The presentation ceremony was held on June 22 in Shanghai__*__ during the Food Ingredients Asia show (Fi-A). </p>
<p>CREAMIZ&trade; was first introduced as a part of Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s OPTIMIZE platform__*__ aiming to balance recipe costs by replacing fat__*__ without changing the texture. It is also used in Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s CREATEplatform adding a unique smoothness and richness to a product&rsquo;s mouth feel without adding additional fat. CREAMIZ&trade; uses unique starch modification technology to make it a leading contender for fat substitution in a wide range of food products. It will not affect the creaminess of products it is used in__*__ but instead will complement and enhance their existing texture__*__ creating a rich and full bodied flavour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When using CREAMIZ&trade;__*__ a low fat product can have the texture of the full fat version__*__ and a full fat product can have the indulgent mouthfeel of a premium product__*__ at low cost in use. The versatile performance of CREAMIZ&trade; helps our customers respond to consumers&rsquo; increasing need for health and wellness and indulgence__*__&rdquo; said Sebastian Lemke__*__ Senior Product Manager of Tate &amp; Lyle Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s consumer research shows that consumers are not willing to compromise on taste and texture in healthy foods. Their research also shows that &lsquo;creaminess&rsquo; is a key driver in consumer&rsquo;s preference for dairy products. The new ingredient CREAMIZ&trade; from Tate &amp; Lyle adds value to customers by directly addressing these market needs. CREAMIZ&trade; can be used on standard food manufacturing lines and does not require specific equipment to be added. It can be used in wide range of products including yogurts__*__ dairy desserts__*__ and ice-cream.<br />

949,auto,Legacy Import,9/29/2011,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC Trading Update for six months to 30 September 2011,<p>Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading update for the six months ending 30 September 2011 ahead of the announcement of the Half Year Results on Thursday 3 November 2011. </p><p>Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive__*__ said: “The encouraging start to the financial year has continued during the second quarter with solid demand within a number of our markets in both Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients__*__ assisted by strong co-product returns.”<br /><br />OPERATING PERFORMANCE - CONTINUING OPERATIONS * </p><p>In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ corn-based speciality sweetener and starch volumes grew in line with the market. Sucralose volume growth was particularly strong with increased demand to support new customer product launches albeit__*__ as expected__*__ at lower average selling prices. Sucralose volumes are expected to revert to more normal levels during the second half. In our Food Systems business__*__ volumes were lower than our expectations due to tough trading conditions in Russia. <br /><br />Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ US corn sweeteners benefited from good domestic demand and a continuing firm market for corn sugar in Mexico. In Europe the anticipated squeeze in sweetener margins from higher corn prices has been partially offset by higher volumes. Industrial starch volumes in both the Americas and Europe are broadly in line with the prior year although we have improved margins in Europe against a market backdrop of higher demand for corn starches. We expect citric acid sales to be somewhat lower in the first half than the prior year as a result of a more competitive environment__*__ particularly in Latin America. </p><p>* The comments on operating performance exclude the unfavourable impact of currency movements on the translation of first half profits.</p><p>CORN PRICES AND CO-PRODUCTS</p><p>For the previous full financial year (ended 31 March 2011)__*__ we reported <br />£16 million of additional income from co-products following a significant increase in the US corn price__*__ with around two-thirds of this benefit accruing during the second half. </p><p>During the first half of this financial year__*__ we have seen a continuation of favourable market conditions for co-products and in the US we have locked in sales further forward to take advantage of unusually strong demand. In the first half__*__ we anticipate that the additional income from co-products will contribute around double the benefit in the comparative period last year. </p><p>Since over 80% of the corn grind is utilised to produce Bulk Ingredients__*__ the majority of this effect is recorded within this segment. </p><p>DEBT MANAGEMENT <br /><br />In August we paid £79 million in respect of the final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011 and received £24 million in relation to the recovery of tax losses that crystallised as a result of the sale of our ethanol facility in Fort Dodge. As reported in July__*__ we have agreed to make a payment of £45 million into the main UK pension scheme this financial year__*__ half of which has been paid. </p><p>OUTLOOK <br /><br />In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ we expect to achieve steady volume growth within both Sucralose and starch-based speciality ingredients for the remainder of the financial year. Overall within Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ we expect to deliver a year of good sales and profit growth although as previously reported__*__ the level of profit growth is expected to be more modest than the strong result achieved in the prior financial year.<br /><br />In Bulk Ingredients__*__ we expect the firm demand for corn sugars in the US and Mexico to continue__*__ subject to normal seasonal patterns__*__ and stable demand in our other food markets. As usual__*__ the outcome of the 2012 calendar year sweetener pricing rounds will influence performance in the final quarter of the financial year. Industrial starch__*__ particularly in Europe__*__ is expected to perform better than the prior year as a result of higher demand for corn-based starches. </p><p>Overall__*__ and before the gains made during the first half from co-products and any impact from currency movements__*__ our expectations for the full year remain unchanged and we continue to anticipate another year of profitable growth.<br /><br /><br />END</p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8.00am BST__*__ hosted by Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive and Tim Lodge__*__ Chief Financial Officer.

In corn-based speciality sweeteners and starches__*__ we achieved good sales growth on higher volumes. Sucralose volumes grew but below the particularly strong levels seen in the first half. In Food Systems__*__ we also delivered good sales growth with volumes in line with the prior year period.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ North American liquid sweetener volumes continued to benefit from robust levels of domestic and Mexican demand. In Europe__*__ higher sugar prices__*__ which provide a reference price for isoglucose__*__ enabled us to increase liquid sweetener margins despite higher corn prices. While industrial starch margins were ahead of the prior year__*__ volumes were lower as we started to see some softening in demand from European paper and board customers reflecting the more uncertain economic environment.

As a result__*__ and based on current corn prices and exchange rates<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>__*__ we currently anticipate that this will drive a net cash outflow in the final quarter of the financial year and continue to expect that net debt at the end of 31 March 2012 will be somewhat higher than the £464 million at the end of the last financial year.</p><p>CUSTOMER CONTRACTING</p><p>The 2012 calendar year sweetener pricing round in North America for the Bulk Ingredients business is now substantially complete. This pricing round has been conducted against the backdrop of higher corn and process ingredient costs.</p><p>In North America__*__ after recovering these higher input costs__*__ overall we achieved a modest increase in corn sugar unit margins reflecting a continuation of high levels of industry capacity utilisation on the back of robust domestic and Mexican demand. Bulk Ingredients sweetener volumes are likely to be broadly in line with calendar year 2011. In Europe__*__ where we continue to contract over shorter periods to partially mitigate corn cost volatility__*__ we have enhanced sweetener margins against a backdrop of higher sugar prices. </p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>The Group has performed well during the first nine months of the financial year.

Volume growth for the first half is expected to be in line with the market and sales ahead of the prior year period with solid growth in the US and emerging markets offsetting a weaker performance in Europe. We have seen good growth in Sucralose volumes in the second quarter__*__ although overall volumes in the first half are expected to be lower than the comparative period (which included an unusually large volume from customers’ new product launches) primarily due to the more difficult market conditions in Europe. This__*__ together with the impact of the strike in Turkey and the previously announced step change in fixed costs associated with our business transformation initiatives __*__ will result in first half operating profit in this division being lower than the prior year period. </p><p>Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ operating profit is expected to be ahead of the comparative period with a strong performance from liquid sweeteners in both the US and Europe more than offsetting ongoing challenging market conditions in US ethanol. Income from co-products returned to more normal levels during the period. </p><p>While US corn prices have eased slightly since publication of the USDA’s latest supply and demand estimates on 12 September 2012__*__ prices remain high as a result of tight market conditions and continued uncertainty about the size and quality of this year’s harvest following the severe drought in the mid-west. European corn prices have followed a similar pattern to the US. </p><p>DEBT MANAGEMENT <br /><br />During the last quarter__*__ we paid the £83 million final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 and received £15 million in net proceeds following completion of the disposal of our share in Sucromiles__*__ our former Colombian citric-acid joint venture. </p><p>OUTLOOK <br /><br />In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ while we expect continued challenging market conditions in Europe__*__ overall we expect to achieve steady volume growth across all major product categories and solid sales growth for the full year.</p><p>In Bulk Ingredients__*__ we expect the firm demand for liquid sweeteners in the US to continue and demand in our other food markets to remain stable. In Europe__*__ higher corn prices are expected to reduce isoglucose margins in the second half. Market conditions in US ethanol are expected to remain challenging. </p><p>As usual__*__ the outcome of the 2013 calendar year sweetener pricing rounds will influence performance in the final quarter of the financial year.</p><p>Overall__*__ while recognising the current level of uncertainty around the wider economy and volatile corn markets__*__ we continue to expect to make progress this financial year. </p><p>END</p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8:00am BST__*__ hosted by Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive and Tim Lodge__*__ Chief Financial Officer.

1045,auto,Legacy Import,2/1/2013,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT,<p>1 February 2013 – Tate &amp; Lyle PLC </p><p>INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT</p><p>Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following interim management statement covering the period from 1 October 2012 to 31 December 2012. </p><p>OPERATING PERFORMANCE – CONTINUING OPERATIONS</p><p>Group adjusted profit before tax  for the third quarter was broadly in line with our expectations before the impact of exchange rate movements.  As expected__*__ adjusted profit before tax was lower than the comparative period as a result of the step change in fixed costs associated with our business transformation initiatives .  </p><p>Within Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ we achieved good sales growth with volume growth ahead of the wider speciality food ingredients market.  In starch-based speciality ingredients__*__ we achieved good sales growth with volume growth in all regions.  In high intensity sweeteners__*__ while we saw a return towards more normal sucralose volume growth and expect this to continue in the final quarter__*__ the level of growth was not as strong as anticipated in November and we now expect sucralose volumes for the full year to be slightly lower than last year.  In Food Systems__*__ sales were broadly in line with the comparative period on lower volumes.  Operating profit  for the Speciality Food Ingredients division for the full year is now expected to be broadly in line with the prior year.</p><p>Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ overall demand for North American liquid sweeteners was solid during the third quarter.  In Europe__*__ margins for liquid sweeteners were broadly in line with the prior year period.  The markets for industrial starches in both Europe and the US were relatively stable while the environment for US ethanol continued to be challenging.   </p><p>Corn and co-products</p><p>Corn supplies in the US and Europe remained tight and with the latest projections from the USDA for the stocks-to-use ratio at 5.3%__*__ prices are expected to remain high with some volatility over the coming months until the new harvest.</p><p>As announced in November 2012__*__ we have taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of aflatoxin__*__ a fungus caused by the unusually hot and dry conditions last summer.  The impact of aflatoxin from the new harvest corn was felt particularly in the third quarter while we implemented a number of actions including adjustments to our corn sourcing programme.  </p><p>We expect a further small increase in net corn costs in the final quarter of the financial year and estimate the impact of aflatoxin will be to reduce operating profit by around £7 million for the full year.  We will continue to take action to manage the risks posed by aflatoxin during the first half of next financial year up to the new harvest.  </p><p>BALANCE SHEET AND WORKING CAPITAL</p><p>Net debt at 31 December 2012 was £395 million.  In light of continuing tight market conditions in both the US and Europe__*__ we continue to hold high corn inventories for security of supply.  As usual__*__ we have paid for a significant amount of this corn in January__*__ and at higher prices than the prior year.  As a result__*__ and based on current corn prices and exchange rates __*__ we currently anticipate that this will drive a net cash outflow in the final quarter of the financial year.</p><p>CUSTOMER CONTRACTING</p><p>The 2013 calendar year sweetener pricing round in North America for the Bulk Ingredients business is now substantially complete.  As in the previous year__*__ this pricing round has been conducted against the backdrop of materially higher corn costs.</p><p>In North America__*__ after recovering these higher input costs__*__ we achieved a modest increase in corn sweetener unit margins across our sweetener customers reflecting a continuation of high levels of industry capacity utilisation.  Bulk Ingredients sweetener volumes are expected to be broadly in line with calendar year 2012.  </p><p>In Europe__*__ we continue to contract over shorter periods to partially mitigate corn cost volatility.  Despite sugar prices remaining high__*__ sweetener margins are expected to be lower as a result of higher corn costs.  </p><p>OUTLOOK</p><p>The Group has made a solid start to the final quarter.  Despite facing a number of headwinds and before the impact of exchange rate movements__*__ we expect to make modest progress this financial year. </p><p>END</p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8.00am GMT__*__ hosted by Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive and Tim Lodge__*__ Chief Financial Officer.

Using US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 data__*__ a recent study modeled the potential impact of Tate &amp; Lyle’s new sodium reduction technology__*__ SODA-LO™ Salt Microspheres__*__ on sodium intake<sup>2</sup>.</p><p _rdeditor_temp=""1"">Based upon potential usage of SODA-LO™ Salt Microspheres in 953 foods with sodium reductions in these foods ranging from 20-30%__*__ usual intakes were modeled demonstrating a potential 9% reduction in dietary sodium intake equivalent to a 274 and 244 mg/d reduction for those 2+ and 51+ years old__*__ respectively. Specifically__*__ for African Americans__*__ sodium reduction was estimated at 282 and 229 mg/d in those 2+ and 51+ years old__*__ respectively.

1084,auto,Legacy Import,10/4/2013,Press releases,For Immediate Release,4 October 2013 - Tate & Lyle PLC Trading Update for six months ending 30 September 2013,"<p><strong>4 October 2013 - Tate &amp; Lyle PLC</strong> </p><p><strong>Trading Update</strong> </p><p>Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading update for the six months ended 30 September 2013 ahead of the announcement of Half Year Results on Thursday 7 November 2013. </p><p><strong>OPERATING PERFORMANCE – CONTINUING OPERATIONS </strong></p><p>The Group’s performance in the second quarter was broadly in line with our expectations.  Adjusted  operating profit for the Group for the first half is expected to be slightly lower than the comparative period__*__ largely driven by softness in the US beverage sector as a result of the cold spring and slow start to the summer which has affected sweetener volumes in both divisions.</p><p>In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ volume growth is expected to be in line with the wider speciality food ingredients market with strong volume growth in emerging markets and Europe__*__ partially offset by slightly lower volumes in the US.  We saw strong demand for our texturant and fibre ingredients__*__ particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America__*__ but softness in the US beverage sector held back volume growth across our higher margin speciality sweeteners.  This__*__ together with lower selling prices for SPLENDA® Sucralose__*__ is expected to result in operating profit in this division being broadly in line with the prior year period in constant currency.</p><p>Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ operating profit is expected to be somewhat lower than the comparative period driven by lower US bulk liquid sweetener volumes.  During the second quarter__*__ we largely mitigated the increased costs associated with poor end of season corn quality and resultant lower starch production yields__*__ and the significant decrease in the corn price.   </p><p><strong>OUTLOOK</strong> </p><p>In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ we expect to deliver growth in volumes__*__ sales and profits across all regions for the full year. </p><p>Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ in North America we expect solid demand for liquid sweeteners and stable demand for our other products.  In Europe__*__ lower corn prices are expected to more than offset the impact of lower sugar prices on isoglucose margins.  Consequently__*__ we anticipate this division delivering a stronger performance during the second half than the same period last year__*__ and full year profits to be more evenly distributed between the first and second half.</p><p>Our profits remain sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency particularly the US dollar to sterling exchange rate.  In addition__*__ as usual__*__ the outcome of the calendar year sweetener pricing rounds will influence performance in the final quarter of the financial year.  </p><p>Overall__*__ we expect to deliver another year of profitable growth.</p><p><strong>END</strong></p><p>A conference call will be held today at 8:00am BST__*__ hosted by Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive and Tim Lodge__*__ Chief Financial Officer.

<br />
INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following interim management statement for the three months ended 31 December 2013. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>THIRD QUARTER OPERATING PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ volumes were broadly in line with the prior year period__*__ with strong growth in emerging markets offset by softness in developed markets.  Within high intensity sweeteners__*__ volume and sales growth in SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:14px;""><sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup></span>Sucralose were in line with the levels reported during the first half of the year and our expectations.  In Bulk Ingredients__*__ we saw an improved performance from US sweeteners and US ethanol relative to the comparative period__*__ but lower returns from co-products held back the division&rsquo;s performance overall.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In December 2013__*__ we completed the back-to-back purchase__*__ sale and leaseback of our building  in Hoffman Estates__*__ US__*__ providing us with greater operating control in managing this facility.  The transaction generated a profit of &pound;6 million__*__ the majority of which was included in the Speciality Food Ingredients division.  </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Excluding the one-off benefit relating to the Hoffman Estates transaction__*__ underlying profits in both divisions were well ahead of the prior year period.  However__*__ due to volume softness in developed markets and lower returns from co-products__*__ Group adjusted profit before tax  was lower than our expectations.   </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>CONTRACTING ROUND</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">The 2014 calendar year pricing round is now largely complete.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In Bulk Ingredients__*__ unit margins for liquid corn sweeteners in North America will be modestly lower in the 2014 calendar year.  After the soft beverage season in 2013__*__ which was caused by the unusually cold spring and summer__*__ a return to more normal seasonal demand patterns in 2014 should largely offset this.  In Europe__*__ sweetener margins are expected to be broadly in line__*__ with lower corn costs offset by a reduction in sugar prices. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ within our starch-based speciality ingredients__*__ we expect overall unit margins in the 2014 calendar year will be modestly higher than the comparative period.  </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;text-align:justify;""><strong>SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:12px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> SUCRALOSE</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:11.66667px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Sucralose__*__ we have recently renewed a number of customer contracts__*__ some of which are multi-year.  These have been completed in a dynamic market where the competitive environment has intensified__*__ driven we believe by a significant overhang of unsold Chinese sucralose.  With these contracts in place__*__ we anticipate the rate of price decline in SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:11.66667px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span><span style=""font-size:14px;""> Sucralose</span> will increase in the final quarter and__*__ based on what we see today and current market dynamics__*__ expect prices in the 2015 financial year to be around 15% lower than the current financial year.  We continue to see good long-term opportunities for growth in the market for SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:12px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Sucralose leading to operational efficiencies as we continue to fill our McIntosh facility.  </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">We are also separately announcing today the establishment of a new SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:12px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Alliance with McNeil Nutritionals.  The Alliance includes terms for ongoing supply which will be effective when the current supply agreement expires in April.  That agreement was signed in 2004 when the Sucralose business was realigned.  The terms of that realignment included the making of annual payments by McNeil to Tate &amp; Lyle based on McNeil&rsquo;s sales of table top products during the 10 years following the realignment.  These payments are not a feature of the new Alliance and accordingly__*__ the final such payment will be received in respect of the year ending 31 March 2014 and is expected to amount to approximately     $11 million (&pound;7 million).</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>BALANCE SHEET</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Net debt at 31 December 2013 was &pound;253 million (30 September 2013 &ndash; &pound;336 million).  While the recent bumper harvest in the US has eased pressure on corn stocks__*__ we continue to maintain prudent levels of corn within our silos for security of supply.  Based on current corn prices and exchange rates__*__ we expect the payment for new crop corn held in our silos to result in a net cash outflow in the final quarter.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>STRATEGIC PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Overall__*__ we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making and particularly the underlying strength of our Speciality Food Ingredients business.  SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:12px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Sucralose aside__*__ in the 2014 financial year we expect to see profit growth in all product categories across Speciality Food Ingredients.  The significant growth delivered in these product categories over the last four years means that they now represent a much larger and more meaningful part of our Speciality Food Ingredients business.  This__*__ together with a robust innovation pipeline and strong growth momentum in emerging markets__*__ demonstrates that our long-term strategy of evolving Tate &amp; Lyle into a more global and higher quality business remains firmly on track.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""> <strong>OUTLOOK</strong> </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Overall__*__ the Group has made a solid start to the final quarter.  As a result of the operating performance in the third quarter and lower SPLENDA<span style=""font-size:12px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Sucralose pricing in the final quarter__*__ at constant rates of exchange we now expect full year profits for the year ending 31 March 2014 to be broadly in line with the comparative period. </p>

<strong>2000</strong> McNeil's McIntosh plant__*__ the world&rsquo;s first integrated sucralose production facility__*__ mechanically complete<br />
<strong>2001</strong>  Global Sucralose Alliance announced__*__ providing for the realignment of Tate &amp; Lyle and McNeil sucralose activities. Under the realigned arrangements__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle to act as exclusive broker for sucralose ingredient sales in certain key markets; McNeil to market SPLENDA Brand tabletop products exclusively<br />
<strong>2003</strong>  EU approval for sucralose<br />
<strong>2004</strong>  Further Sucralose realignment with Tate &amp; Lyle becoming the sole manufacturer and responsible for worldwide ingredient sales of SPLENDA Sucralose to food and beverage manufacturers and McNeil responsible for the worldwide SPLENDA Brand retail and food service business. As part of the realignment__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle acquired McNeil&rsquo;s sucralose manufacturing plant and other ingredient business assets for &pound;71 million<br />
The realignment included arrangements by which each company would participate in the success of the other. In the case of Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ deferred consideration was payable to McNeil for the first five years dependent on Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s sucralose ingredient sales (above a target level).  Tate &amp; Lyle in turn received payments from McNeil based on McNeil sales of sucralose tabletop products for 10 years from the date of completion of the transaction.  The aggregate amount paid to McNeil over the five years by Tate &amp; Lyle amounted to &pound;37 million.

<p><strong>New Alliance with McNeil Nutritionals</strong></p>
<p>Tate &amp; Lyle PLC announces today the latest phase of its 30-year Sucralose partnership with McNeil Nutritionals__*__ LLC through the establishment of a renewed SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Alliance.  The focus for the renewed partnership will be the development and growth of the global market for Sucralose and the SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand.  This is a natural evolution of the long-term partnership that has nurtured the success of Sucralose and the SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand__*__ following the strategic realignment announced in 2004. At that time__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle took over McNeil Nutritionals&rsquo; Sucralose manufacturing assets and responsibility for worldwide food and beverage ingredient sales__*__ while McNeil Nutritionals__*__ LLC retained ownership of the SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand and the retail and food service business.</p>
<p>Both companies will partner on the continued development and promotion of the SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand and Sucralose__*__ including ingredient and brand protection initiatives.  The new arrangements include terms for ongoing supply upon expiration of the current agreement.  The partnership will continue to leverage the strengths of each company and ensure the continued growth of the SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose business and the SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand globally.</p>
<p>Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive of Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ said:<br />
&ldquo;We are delighted about the continuation of our established 30-year partnership with McNeil Nutritionals and look forward to the next phase of the relationship. Alongside our global partners__*__ we are committed to growing the global market for SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Sucralose__*__ which remains the high intensity sweetener of choice due to its superior taste profile and stability__*__ enabling its use across a broad range of applications. Together__*__ we will continue to ensure that the SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand remains the benchmark within the industry for quality__*__ reliability and innovation well into the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>END</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes to editors: selected historical background relating to SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Sucralose based on previous disclosures</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>1976</strong>  Discovery of sucralose by Tate &amp; Lyle and Queen Elizabeth's College__*__ University of London researchers<br />
<strong>1980</strong> First agreements between Tate &amp; Lyle and Johnson &amp; Johnson.  These were patent licences creating exclusive geographical territories for the two companies &ndash; for Johnson &amp; Johnson__*__ North America (excluding Canada)__*__ South America__*__ the Caribbean__*__ the Middle East and Australasia; for Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ Europe__*__ Canada__*__ Africa and Asia<br />
<strong>1991</strong>  First approval granted for sucralose (Canada)<br />
<strong>1998</strong> US FDA approval for sucralose obtained<br />
<strong>2000</strong> McNeil's McIntosh plant__*__ the world&rsquo;s first integrated sucralose production facility__*__ mechanically complete<br />
<strong>2001</strong>  Global Sucralose Alliance announced__*__ providing for the realignment of Tate &amp; Lyle and McNeil sucralose activities. Under the realigned arrangements__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle to act as exclusive broker for sucralose ingredient sales in certain key markets; McNeil to market SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand tabletop products exclusively<br />
<strong>2003</strong>  EU approval for sucralose<br />
<strong>2004</strong>  Further Sucralose realignment with Tate &amp; Lyle becoming the sole manufacturer and responsible for worldwide ingredient sales of SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Sucralose to food and beverage manufacturers and McNeil responsible for the worldwide SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Brand retail and food service business. As part of the realignment__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle acquired McNeil&rsquo;s sucralose manufacturing plant and other ingredient business assets for &pound;71 million<br />
The realignment included arrangements by which each company would participate in the success of the other. In the case of Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ deferred consideration was payable to McNeil for the first five years dependent on Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s sucralose ingredient sales (above a target level).  Tate &amp; Lyle in turn received payments from McNeil based on McNeil sales of sucralose tabletop products for 10 years from the date of completion of the transaction.  The aggregate amount paid to McNeil over the five years by Tate &amp; Lyle amounted to &pound;37 million.  Assuming receipt of the &pound;7 million payment anticipated in respect of the year ending 31 March 2014__*__ the final such payment__*__ the aggregate of the payments received from McNeil will amount to &pound;75 million<br />
<strong>2014</strong> New SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Alliance announced</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Within Bulk Ingredients__*__ we continue to expect operating profit for the full year to be lower than the comparative period as a result of the soft beverage season in the US__*__ which reduced demand for liquid corn sweeteners__*__ and lower returns from co-products.

1112,auto,Legacy Import,6/11/2014,Press releases,For Immediate Release,American Heart Association Conference Highlights Innovative Solutions for Reducing Sodium Intake via Reducing Sodium in the Food Supply,"<p><strong>(CHICAGO__*__ Ill.) &ndash; 11 June 2014 &ndash; </strong>Sodium intake around the world continues to be of concern<sup>1</sup> and public health authorities hypothesise that it may be linked with cardiovascular disease risk<sup>2</sup>. In an effort to identify ways to reduce the amount of sodium consumed and provided in the food supply__*__ the <a href=""http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/"" target=""_blank"">American Heart Association</a> brought together over 100 key stakeholders and thought leaders at a special conference in June 2013. Proceedings from the conference were published in the May 2014 <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2014/05/05/CIR.0000000000000051"" target=""_blank"">edition</a> of Circulation<sup>3</sup>. <br />
<br />
Among the top priorities identified by the group were increasing consumer understanding for the need to reduce sodium intake and the use of food technologies to reduce sodium in the food supply as much as possible. In an effort to advance sodium reduction technology__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle showcased an ingredient at the conference__*__ <a href=""http://www.soda-lo.com/Pages/SODA-LO.aspx"" target=""_blank"">SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres</a>__*__ which has the potential to be a major contributor for reducing sodium in the marketplace.  <br />
<br />
According to the American Heart Association publication__*__ new food technologies__*__ like SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres__*__ can lower the sodium content of foods and are one part of the solution for meeting public health recommendations<sup>3</sup>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Sodium Reduction Innovation: SODA-LO&reg; Salt Microspheres</strong><br />
SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres is a salt-reduction ingredient that tastes__*__ functions__*__ and may label* like salt because it is salt. It can reduce sodium by 25 to 50% in food applications such as bread and salty snacks. SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> is created using a patented technology that transforms standard salt crystals into free-flowing__*__ hollow salt microspheres that efficiently deliver salty taste by maximising surface area relative to volume. <br />
<br />
Research presented at the conference showed the potential impact of replacing salt with SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> on overall sodium intake. Using US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 data<sup>3</sup>__*__ the potential usage of SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> in 953 foods allowing 20-30% sodium reduction was modelled assuming a 50 or 100% market penetration. Results of the dietary modelling demonstrated that sodium intakes could decrease by 4% to 9% across age__*__ sex__*__ and ethnic groups. This reduction is equivalent to 130 to 360 mg/day. SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres can serve as one solution to help decrease population sodium intake. While changing consumer palates for foods lower in sodium may require significant time<sup>4</sup>__*__ interim technologies like SODA-LO&reg; can provide an immediate solution for sodium intake reduction. <br />
<br />
&lsquo;Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ as a leader in sodium reduction technology__*__ can offer food manufacturers a novel__*__ great tasting ingredient that can be used in products  that consumers will enjoy and continue to demand__*__&rsquo; stated Mike Harrison__*__ Senior Vice President of New Product Development at Tate &amp; Lyle. <br />
<br />
SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres is the result of Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s Open Innovation team that creates partnerships to bring the most exciting new food ingredient technologies to market.  Through a license agreement with Eminate__*__ a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Nottingham__*__ UK__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle has exclusive__*__ worldwide rights for product development__*__ manufacturing and commercialisation of the SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres technology. <br />

1113,auto,Legacy Import,6/18/2014,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle to Showcase Ingredient and Application Innovation with New Orleans-Inspired Cuisine at IFT Food Expo,"<p><strong>(CHICAGO__*__ USA) &ndash; 18 June 2014 &ndash; </strong>Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a leading global provider of food ingredients and solutions__*__ is going to feature innovative ingredients and applications through localized culinary concepts at the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) Food Expo June 21-24 in New Orleans__*__ La. (booth #3941). Using groundbreaking ingredients for sodium reduction__*__ zero-calorie sweetness and fiber enrichment__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s world-class culinary and applications teams plan to put a healthier and tastier twist on classic New Orleans dishes. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;The local food scene provided endless inspiration for tasty formulations using our broad ingredient portfolio__*__&rdquo; said Judy Turner__*__ director of culinary__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle. &ldquo;The eclectic__*__ flavorful cuisine really enabled us to show our culinary creativity and our expertise in developing better-for-you options without sacrificing that great New Orleans taste.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<strong>Zero-Calorie Sweetener Innovation Enables Tastier Formulations</strong><br />
<br />
IFT Food Expo attendees are expected to benefit from decades of sweetener innovation and expertise from Tate &amp; Lyle through a refreshing Blood Orange Sangria and Bourbon-flavored Ice Cream. Both prototypes meet consumer demand for sugar reduction while delivering the great taste consumers expect in food and beverage products. <br />
<br />
The stevia-sweetened Blood Orange Sangria achieves more than 50% sugar reduction and has 70% fewer calories (12 grams of sugar and 60 calories in an eight-ounce serving) compared to the full-sugar version (26 grams of sugar and 220 calories in an eight-ounce serving). Through its groundbreaking steviol glycoside composition__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.tastevasweetener.com"" target=""_blank"">TASTEVA<sup>&reg;</sup> Stevia Sweetener</a> enables a sweet blood-orange flavor without the bitter aftertaste associated with other stevia ingredients. This great taste eliminates the need for masking. <br />
<br />
With 100 calories and 6 grams of sugars per four-ounce serving__*__ the Bourbon-flavored Ice Cream with Praline Brittle is another tasty option for IFT Food Expo attendees__*__ boasting the sugar-like sweetness of <a href=""http://www.splendasucralose.com"" target=""_blank"">SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose</a>.

<br />
While according to Innova Market Insights (2013) 83% of consumers say they are concerned about sodium__*__ another <a href=""http://www.foodinsight.org/Press-Release/Detail.aspx?topic=More_Americans_Choosing_Foods_Beverages_Based_on_Healthfulness_"" target=""_blank"">recent study</a> from the International Food Information Council (2014) says that taste is still consumers&rsquo; top priority. With Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres__*__ manufacturers can reduce sodium without sacrificing the salty taste consumers love.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Clean-Label Fiber Options Overcome Color__*__ Taste and Texture Challenges</strong><br />
<br />
According to studies from the Natural Marketing Institute (2013)__*__ fiber is the top nutrient consumers want to add to their diet__*__ and nearly half of consumers say they look for foods with a short list of recognizable ingredients. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s corn- or oat-sourced fibers meet consumer demand for better-for-you options and clean labeling while minimizing formulators&rsquo; challenges in color__*__ taste and texture.<br />
<br />
IFT Food Expo attendees are going to experience Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s newly introduced <a href=""http://www.promoat.com"" target=""_blank"">PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup> Beta Glucan</a> in an Iced Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait with Whipped Coconut Water topping. Delivering up to 35% beta glucan__*__ PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup> can help support a healthy cholesterol level for individuals with cholesterol within the normal range and is free from the taste__*__ color and graininess usually associated with oat-based ingredients.<br />
<br />
Tate &amp; Lyle plans to feature its soluble corn fiber in a Roasted Red Pepper Gazpacho with Cornbread. <a href=""http://www.promitorfiber.com"" target=""_blank"">PROMITOR<sup>&reg;</sup> Soluble Corn Fiber</a> is easily incorporated into a variety of food applications and has been shown in internal sensory testing (2011) to be flavor- and color-neutral__*__ free from chalky or grainy textures.

</em><br />
<strong>(NEW ORLEANS__*__ La.) &ndash; 22 June 2014 &ndash;</strong><br />
<br />
Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a leading global provider of food ingredients and solutions__*__ released key findings today from consumer taste-test research conducted by Ipsos in May 2014. The research revealed that Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s proprietary TASTEVA&reg; Stevia Sweetener is preferred by nearly two out of three consumers (63%) over rebaudioside A__*__ a prevalent stevia ingredient often associated with bitter aftertastes.<br />
<br />
Participants in the study tasted two fruit-drink beverages. One was sweetened with TASTEVA&reg; Stevia Sweetener__*__ and the other was sweetened with rebaudioside A.<br />
<br />
In addition to overall taste preference__*__ nearly two out of three consumers (63%) found the fruit drink sweetened with TASTEVA&reg; Stevia Sweetener to have a &ldquo;pleasant aftertaste&rdquo; or &ldquo;no aftertaste__*__&rdquo; while more than half (54%) found the fruit drink sweetened with rebaudioside A to have an &ldquo;unpleasant&rdquo; aftertaste.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;This research is important because it shows manufacturers they can bring those on-trend__*__ better-for-you products to market without sacrificing clean__*__ sweet taste__*__&rdquo; said Amy Lauer__*__ Marketing Manager__*__ North America__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle. &ldquo;Consumers are demanding low-sugar and low-calorie products &ndash; but taste is always going to be their top priority.

1117,auto,Legacy Import,7/18/2014,Press releases,For Immediate Release,New Research Suggests Soluble Corn Fibre May Boost Calcium Absorption in Adolescents,"<p><strong>(CHICAGO__*__ USA)</strong> &ndash; Around the globe__*__ fibre and calcium intakes are below the levels recommended by expertscontributing to potential long-term public health implications. New research__*__ published this month in the British Journal of Nutrition__*__ shows soluble corn fibre (SCF) may not simply boost fibre intake when added to foods__*__ but can also increase the amount of beneficial bacteria present in the gut__*__ while enhancing calcium absorption in adolescents. SCF is a prebiotic fibre that is well tolerated__*__ and is easily incorporated into foods or beverages to boost fibre content. These latest results showing SCF can enhance calcium absorption are significant because during adolescence__*__ a critical time for bone growth__*__ dairy intake tends to decrease__*__ resulting in inadequate calcium intake which is a vital mineral for building and maintaining strong bones.<br />
<br />
Researchers studied the potential effect of SCF on calcium absorption and retention in adolescent children with a usual diet that was low in fibre. In a controlled dietary study__*__ adolescent girls and boys who consumed 12g/day fibre from SCF absorbed significantly more calcium (a 12% increase versus a control) than when consuming no SCF. Additionally__*__ the researchers found that when the adolescents consumed SCF__*__ there was an increase in specific strains of beneficial gut bacteria__*__ namely the phylum Bacteroidetes__*__ and these increases were positively correlated with increases in calcium absorption. These results indicate that moderate daily intake of SCF may increase beneficial gut bacteria and also short-term calcium absorption in adolescents who are consuming less than recommended amounts of calcium.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;A decrease in milk consumption among adolescents has led to an increase in deficiency of calcium in the diet__*__ leaving researchers with a particular interest in finding functional foods that can help increase calcium absorption__*__&rsquo; stated Connie Weaver__*__ PhD__*__ of Purdue University and lead researcher of the study. &lsquo;Dietary factors that enhance bone density and bone mineral content have the potential to contribute to reduced risk of bone fracture later in life.&rsquo;<br />
<br />
If the adolescents in this study had continued to consume SCF__*__ allowing for increased calcium absorption__*__ the researchers estimated that this would lead to additional 41.4 mg/day retained calcium and if persistent over a year would account for an additional 15.1 g of calcium__*__ or about 1.8% of total body calcium. <br />
<br />
&lsquo;On average__*__ people aren&rsquo;t meeting their fibre or calcium intake goals with the foods they currently consume. Adding fibres with functional health benefits to already consumed foods is a realistic and simple way to help address this global public health concern among key age groups__*__&rsquo; said Michael Harrison__*__ PhD__*__ Senior Vice President of New Product Development at Tate &amp; Lyle. &lsquo;Tate &amp; Lyle has consistently shown a commitment to investing in research that leads to the production of high quality ingredients that allow people to live well and improve their health.&rsquo; <br />
<br />
The soluble corn fibre used in the study was added to fruit snacks and provided by Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a global provider of high-quality__*__ specialty ingredients. <br />

1119,auto,Legacy Import,7/24/2014,Press releases,For Immediate Release,Tate & Lyle PLC INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT,"<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>24 July 2014 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle PLC</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">This Interim Management Statement covers the period from 1 April 2014 to 30 June 2014__*__ which is the first quarter of the financial year.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>OPERATING PERFORMANCE<br />
<br />
</strong>The Group had a challenging first quarter as we dealt with the anticipated impact of the prolonged and severe winter in the US and also an unexpected shut down of our SPLENDA Sucralose facility in Singapore.  These factors__*__ together with the adverse impact of the strength of sterling against the US dollar and other currencies__*__ meant that Group adjusted operating profit for the first quarter was below our expectations.  However__*__ overall customer demand remains strong and we continue to expect that the Group&rsquo;s results in constant currency for the financial year will be broadly in line with our expectations when we announced our full-year results in May 2014. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">As previously indicated__*__ the first quarter started slowly in the US following the prolonged and severe winter which caused operational difficulties at the corn plants and led us to enter the current financial year with much lower inventories than usual. Although the impact on Bulk Ingredients was less than originally anticipated__*__ it was greater on Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ as we had to balance production to best meet our customers&rsquo; needs.  Inventories continue to re-build and are expected to return to more normal levels in the current quarter.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ we once again delivered good volume growth in the emerging markets although overall growth was held back by the US where__*__ despite firm demand__*__ volumes were only marginally ahead of the comparable period as a result of the supply constraints.  The &pound;100 million investment programme announced in May will provide greater flexibility to mitigate this kind of issue in the future.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">Volumes for SPLENDASucralose in the quarter were slightly lower than we expected predominantly due to a change in a large customer&rsquo;s order pattern.  Overall__*__ the sucralose market continues to be competitive and dynamic with the pressure on pricing in line with our expectations.   </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">Following an industrial accident__*__ production at our Singapore facility was temporarily suspended while the local authorities conducted their investigations and remained shut down for a longer period than we originally anticipated.  We incurred &pound;3 million of costs to resolve issues caused by this unexpected stoppage.  During the quarter there was limited production and customer orders were largely met from inventories.  As a result__*__ fixed manufacturing costs of &pound;8 million were expensed and reduced profits for the quarter__*__ but these will reverse in the second half of the year. We also brought forward and will extend the running time at our McIntosh facility in the US although this had limited impact in the quarter due to the normal lead times. Both plants are now running with Singapore returning to normal production levels.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">As expected__*__ sales in Bulk Ingredients in North America were constrained by entering the financial year with much lower inventories in the US than usual following the prolonged and severe winter. This impacted most product lines__*__ although it was less than originally anticipated__*__ and was also partially mitigated by firmer ethanol margins.  </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;""><strong>DEBT MANAGEMENT AND BALANCE SHEET<br />
</strong><br />
The Group&rsquo;s financial position strengthened during the period.  Net debt of &pound;271 million at 30 June 2014 has reduced from &pound;353 million at 31 March 2014__*__ aided by the translation effects of a stronger sterling.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">Following the quarter end__*__ we renewed the Group&rsquo;s US$800 million committed revolving credit facility for a further period of five years.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>OUTLOOK</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">Overall__*__ the Group&rsquo;s full year performance__*__ before the impact of exchange rate movements__*__ is expected to be broadly in line with our previous guidance.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">Performance in the first half will be impacted by the supply constraints in the first quarter and the temporary Singapore shut down__*__ while the second half will benefit from the reversal of the Singapore costs.  Accordingly__*__ Group profits are expected to be weighted to the second half of the financial year.</p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;margin:0cm 0cm 10pt;text-align:justify;"">The underlying divisional mix of profits in the first quarter is expected to be reflected in the full year and consequently we now expect the performance of Speciality Food Ingredients for the full year to be slightly lower than we anticipated.  However__*__ demand continues to be strong and__*__ notwithstanding current market conditions for sucralose__*__ for the full year Speciality Food Ingredients is expected to deliver volume growth above the wider speciality food ingredients market.  <br />

1162,Alissa Clarke,Tate & Lyle,9/30/2014,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle Introduces New CLARIA® Functional Clean-Label Starches with High Performance and Great Taste,"<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><em>Proprietary technology of CLARIA Functional Clean-Label Starches empowers manufacturers globally to formulate label-friendly products without compromising quality</em></p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">(LONDON) &ndash; 30 September 2014 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a leading global provider of food ingredients and solutions__*__ today launched CLARIA<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> Functional Clean-Label Starches. The new CLARIA<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span> line provides manufacturers similar functionality to modified food starch plus the added benefits of a clean taste and clean label. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">CLARIA<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span>&nbsp;Functional Clean-Label Starches enable manufacturers to meet increasing consumer demand for simpler ingredient lists. This trend is supported by the fact that nearly 25% of new product launches globally were positioned as label-friendly in 2013 (Innova Market Insights). </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">&lsquo;Tate &amp; Lyle recognised the need for a high-performing starch with similar functionality to a modified starch with all the benefits of a clean label&rsquo;__*__ said Esther Van Onselen__*__ Global Marketing Category Director__*__ Texturants and Convenience Foods at Tate &amp; Lyle. &lsquo;Although consumers demand simpler ingredient labels__*__ taste and product experience are still primary drivers. The CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line helps provide a solution to address both of these needs&rsquo;. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches outperform other clean-label starches when it comes to meeting consumer expectations for taste__*__ texture and appearance. Internal colourimetric and sensory testing demonstrated that the CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line has a very neutral flavour profile and colour that is comparable to modified starches. This facilitates their incorporation in food categories that have historically had limited options with functional clean-label starches. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In addition to meeting high sensory standards__*__ CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches enable manufacturers to formulate with similar functionality of a modified food starch. The patent-pending technology of the CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line enables tolerance to shear__*__ heat and acid__*__ even under extreme conditions like ultra-high-temperatures (UHT) and homogenisation. It also demonstrates high thickening efficiency and texture consistency over time. &lsquo;Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s technology is unique in the marketplace because it enables the use of a simple &ldquo;starch&rdquo; label and similar performance to modified starches__*__ with a clean taste and neutral colour. The technical and scientific advancement lies in Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s proprietary processing__*__ which allows the CLARIAstarch granules to remain intact throughout different processing conditions&rsquo;__*__ said Werner Barbosa__*__ Platform Leader__*__ Texturants at Tate &amp; Lyle. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches are versatile across a broad range of applications and sophisticated processes including soups__*__ sauces__*__ dressings__*__ prepared meals and yoghurt. The full line includes three products that have different levels of process tolerance: CLARIAEssential__*__ CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Plus and CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Elite. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Food and beverage manufacturers in North America__*__ Europe__*__ China__*__ Australasia and Latin America can now partner with Tate &amp; Lyle to formulate with the CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line. &lsquo;We have a world-class team of applications experts eager to co-create with manufacturers to bring the next generation of cleaner-label products to market with CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches&rsquo;__*__ said Jim Carr__*__ Director Food Applications__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle. &lsquo;With our extensive expertise in ingredient formulation__*__ we can help customers solve their texture challenges across a wide range of applications&rsquo;. </p>
<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">With the introduction of CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle offers manufacturers more choice to develop label-friendly new products. The CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line forms part of a full portfolio of label-friendly solutions including SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres__*__ TASTEVA<sup>&reg;</sup> Stevia Sweetener__*__ PUREFRUIT&trade; Monk Fruit Extract__*__ PROMITOR<sup>&reg;</sup> Soluble Gluco Fibre and PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup> Beta Glucan. </p>

1173,Lucy Huang,Tate & Lyle,2/6/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle PLC Trading Statement,"<p style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>6 February 2015 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle PLC</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>TRADING STATEMENT</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
With the annual sweetener pricing round largely complete__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading statement for the three months ended 31 December 2014. </p>
<p style=""font-size:14px;"">THIRD QUARTER OPERATING PERFORMANCE<br />
&bull;Speciality Food Ingredients in line with our expectations<br />
&bull;Bulk Ingredients weaker driven by lower US sweetener volumes and ethanol margins<br />
&bull;Diagnostic review of global supply chain confirms no material incremental capital investment is required; improvements to operating and internal planning processes being implemented<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>SPECIALITY FOOD INGREDIENTS</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ excluding SPLENDA<span style=""text-align:justify;color:#4D4D4F;line-height:14.4px;font-family:Arial__*__Helvetica__*__sans-serif;font-size:14px;background-color:#FFFEFF;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span><span style=""color:#4D4D4F;font-size:11pt;background-color:#FFFEFF;"">&nbsp;Sucralose__*__ performed in line with our expectations__*__ with volumes slightly ahead of the prior year period driven by solid growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Customer demand for new products launched from our innovation pipeline remains high__*__ with these new products delivering another quarter of strong volume growth.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size:14px;""><span style=""font-size:14px;"">
SPLENDA<span style=""text-align:justify;color:#4D4D4F;line-height:14.4px;font-family:Arial__*__Helvetica__*__sans-serif;font-size:14px;background-color:#FFFEFF;""><sup>&reg;</sup></span><span style=""color:#4D4D4F;line-height:115%;font-family:Calibri__*__sans-serif;font-size:9pt;"">&nbsp;</span>Sucralose performed in line with our expectations with volumes slightly lower than the prior year period. The sucralose market remained__*__ and looks set to continue to be__*__ extremely competitive and our approach remains only to compete for volumes where we see value. We expect to conclude the project to evaluate how best to maximise returns from this product by the end of the current quarter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We continue to invest in the higher growth emerging markets. On 8 December 2014__*__ we acquired a majority equity interest in Gemacom Tech Ind&uacute;stria e Com&eacute;rcio S.A. (Gemacom)__*__ the leading domestically-owned Food Systems business in Brazil. In December__*__ we also re-purchased certain distribution rights to sell crystalline fructose directly to customers primarily in Asia Pacific for a consideration of US$18million. This will be treated as an exceptional cost in the full year income statement.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>BULK INGREDIENTS</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Bulk Ingredients performed below the prior year period driven by the impact of lower US sweetener volumes in part due to capacity constraints in the wider US transportation network__*__ weakening EU sugar prices which affected bulk sweetener prices in Europe__*__ and a sharp deterioration in ethanol margins near the end of the period. The combined impact of these industry-related factors meant that Bulk Ingredients performed below our expectations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Consistent with our strategy to dampen commodities volatility__*__ we have progressively re-positioned our Bulk Ingredients business such that tolling contracts now represent around 75% of US corn sweetener volumes. Contracts in the 2015 calendar year pricing round for the remaining 25% of corn sweetener volumes were renewed at higher unit margins__*__ although this benefit for the overall division will be offset in the final quarter and into the 2016 financial year by a combination of lower volumes as grind is diverted to Speciality Food Ingredients and the impact of continued pricing pressure in US ethanol and EU bulk sweetener markets.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>REVIEW OF DEMAND__*__ SUPPLY AND PLANNING PROCESSES</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The diagnostic review of global demand__*__ supply and planning processes announced in September 2014 has been completed. This confirms that the programme of incremental capital expenditure announced as part of our May 2014 full year results__*__ together with ongoing actions to increase inventory held closer to our customers__*__ will allow us to better manage customer needs going forward. Accordingly__*__ no material incremental capital investment is required beyond the already announced incremental capital expenditure which we expect to come on stream in the second half of the 2016 financial year. The review also confirms that improvements are needed to operating and supply chain planning capabilities and to the robustness of internal planning processes.
A programme to implement these improvements is underway__*__ with a number of short-term actions already in place__*__ and it is anticipated this will take 12 to 18 months to embed fully. Together__*__ these actions are expected to improve the capabilities required to support future growth in our Speciality Food Ingredients business. </span></p>
<p style=""font-size:14px;"">As previously reported__*__ we expect to incur costs of around &pound;40 million in the current financial year as a result of operational and supply chain disruption. Of this__*__ around &pound;15 million relates to operational costs which are not expected to reoccur in the next financial year. The remaining costs relate mainly to lost sales due to product unavailability and while we expect a return to normal levels of growth off a lower base__*__ we do not expect to see the incremental benefit of the recovery of these lost sales in the 2016 financial year. </p>
<p style=""font-size:14px;""><strong>BALANCE SHEET</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Net debt at 31 December 2014 was &pound;466 million (30 September 2014 &ndash; &pound;383 million)__*__ reflecting investments in future growth including the continued deployment of capital expenditure previously announced__*__ the acquisition of a majority stake in Gemacom__*__ and the repurchase of crystalline fructose distribution rights. The effect of exchange translation was to increase net debt by &pound;15 million.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2015</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
While Speciality Food Ingredients is anticipated to continue to perform in line with our expectations__*__ following the weak performance of Bulk Ingredients in the third quarter driven by lower US sweetener volumes and pressure in ethanol and EU bulk sweetener markets__*__ which we anticipate will continue through the fourth quarter__*__ we now expect Group profits for the full financial year to be modestly below the range stated in September 2014 of &pound;230 to &pound;245 million <sup><span style=""font-size:11px;"">1</span><span style=""font-size:10px;"">&nbsp;</span></sup>.</p>

While authorities continue to call for people to lower their sodium intake__*__ much progress still needs to be made and multiple solutions are necessary to meet the recommended maximum intake of 2__*__300 milligrams per day for the general population and 1__*__500 milligrams per day for at-risk groups<sup>3</sup>. Two recent dietary modeling studies assessed the potential impact of a sodium reduction ingredient on sodium intake for both the general population as well as ethnic population subgroups__*__ and extrapolated future healthcare cost savings associated with reduced blood pressure that could be achieved with reductions in sodium intake.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
New research__*__ published this month in Food Science &amp; Nutrition__*__ provides the most recent estimates of sodium intake among the U.S. population and assesses the potential impact of a sodium reduction technology on sodium intake via a modeling analysis<sup>4</sup>. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 data that included over 17__*__000 participants__*__ the study found that sodium reduction using Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Salt Microspheres could potentially decrease sodium intake by 230-300 milligrams per day or about 7-9% of total sodium intake among the U.S. population depending on age and gender group. SODA-LO<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>Salt Microspheres is a salt-reduction ingredient that can reduce sodium in certain foods through its technology__*__ which turns standard salt crystals into hollow salt microspheres that efficiently deliver salt taste and functionality by maximizing surface area.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Changing consumer behavior is difficult__*__ and some attempts to encourage individuals to lower dietary salt intake have largely proven to be ineffective<sup>5</sup>. Thus__*__ using technology like SODA-LO<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>Salt Microspheres could be instrumental in improving dietary intake and health among the U.S. population. The potential decrease of sodium intake by 300 milligrams per day in adults age 19-50 years is predicted to reduce systolic blood pressure by 0.45 to 0.88 mm Hg and potentially yield US$3.0 to US $5.3 billion in healthcare cost savings annually<sup>4</sup>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A second study published in Nutrition Journal also used NHANES 2007-2010 data to model the potential impact of SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Salt Microspheres on sodium intake in ethnic population subgroups who have higher risk for hypertension and associated diseases<sup>6</sup>. Based upon potential usage of SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Salt Microspheres__*__ there was a reduction of 185-323 milligrams sodium per day__*__ which translates to a 6.3-8.4% reduction of current sodium intake in ethnic population subgroups__*__ representing a meaningful reduction in these subgroups whose current intake exceeds recommendations.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Together__*__ these two studies demonstrate how ingredient technologies like SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Salt Microspheres can provide immediate solutions to reducing sodium intake while meeting consumer taste preferences__*__ and ultimately improving public health__*__&rdquo; said Michael Harrison__*__ PhD__*__ Senior Vice President__*__ New Product Development__*__ Innovation and Commercial Development at Tate &amp; Lyle. &ldquo;Tate &amp; Lyle is committed to providing food manufacturers with effective solutions that can help consumers lower their sodium intake and meet their current health and wellness needs.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

1176,Lauren Vogel,Tate & Lyle,2/24/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle launches DOLCIA PRIMA™ Low-Calorie Sugar,"<p style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;text-align:left;""><em>Now low-calorie versions of consumers&rsquo; favourite food and beverage brands can taste the same as the full-sugar versions&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Launch Inspires Further Commitment to Weight Management and Diabetes Education &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
(LONDON) &ndash; 24 February 2015 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a leading global provider of food ingredients and solutions today announced the launch of <a href=""http://www.dolciaprima.com"">DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; Low-Calorie Sugar</a>__*__ its newest ingredient set to transform the way the food and beverage industry develops low- or reduced-calorie products. DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; is Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s brand name for allulose__*__ a low-calorie sugar that exists in nature and can be found in small quantities in some fruits and foods people eat every day. It was first identified in wheat in the 1930s. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; delivers the satisfying mouthfeel and sweetness of table sugar__*__ but contains 90% fewer calories__*__ so food and beverage manufacturers are expected to be able to significantly reduce the calories in products while maintaining the same taste and enjoyment of sugar that consumers demand.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;One of the biggest challenges our industry faces is reducing calories while maintaining the taste experience consumers expect from their favourite foods and beverages&rsquo;__*__ said Abigail Storms__*__ Vice President__*__ Platform Management__*__ Sweeteners__*__ at Tate &amp; Lyle. &lsquo;Now food and beverage manufacturers can contribute to this public health challenge by using DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; Low-Calorie Sugar. Working with DOLCIA PRIMA&trade;__*__ our culinary teams have learned that it is possible to provide consumers with products with all the taste__*__ all the mouthfeel and all the texture they expect__*__ but without all the calories. In taste trials__*__ consumers ranked low-calorie versions of foods made with DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; equally with the full-calorie versions&rsquo;.<br />
<br />
<strong>Formulating for the future&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; Low-Calorie Sugar can be used in a range of applications including beverages__*__ yoghurt__*__ ice cream and baked products to reduce calories or to make lower-calorie options taste even better. Unlike high-potency sweeteners__*__ DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; is 70% as sweet as sucrose (sugar) and has the same temporal taste profile__*__ which means it provides a clean__*__ sweet taste as well as the functionality of sugar. In fact__*__ products made with DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; ranked at parity with full-calorie full-sugar versions in preference taste tests across a variety of foods.<br />
<br />
DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; can be formulated successfully into many different food products that usually contain sugar because it delivers many of the benefits that sugar offers__*__ such as adequate browning when baking__*__ bulk and texture. It can also depress the freezing point when making frozen products. It is a highly-soluble__*__ liquid ingredient__*__ which means it is easy to use in liquid products and adds bulk and texture in formulations. Tate &amp; Lyle applications experts have developed optimised methods to incorporate DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; into a variety of products and continue to add new developments all the time.1<br />
<strong><br />
Allulose 101: A sugar naturally low in calories</strong><br />
<br />
Allulose is a low-calorie sugar__*__ one of many sugars that exist in nature. &nbsp;It delivers both the satisfying mouthfeel and sweetness of sugar__*__ but without all the calories. DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; Low-Calorie Sugar is Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s brand name for allulose.<br />
<br />
Allulose is a low-calorie sugar first identified in wheat over 70 years ago. It is also found in small quantities in jackfruit__*__ figs and raisins__*__ and in foods such as caramel sauce__*__ maple syrup and brown sugar.<br />
<br />
Tate &amp; Lyle has developed a unique__*__ patent-protected process to produce allulose from basic agricultural raw materials (currently corn in the US).<br />
<br />
Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s food and culinary experts have developed an understanding of how DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; Low-Calorie Sugar can be incorporated into food and beverage formulations so they taste the same as the full-sugar versions__*__ but with significantly fewer calories. DOLCIA PRIMA&trade; can also be used in combination with sweeteners__*__ such as <a href=""http://www.sucralose.com"">SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose</a> and <a href=""http://www.tastevasweetener.com"">TASTEVA<sup>&reg;</sup> Stevia Sweetener</a>__*__ to enable even better sweetening systems.<br />
<br />
Experts from Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s global network of 15 applications laboratories are at customers&rsquo; disposal to work together to develop great-tasting and better-for-you solutions with DOLCIA PRIMA&trade;.<br />

1186,Lucy Huang,Tate & Lyle,4/2/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle PLC - STATEMENT ON ENTERING CLOSE PERIOD,"Tate &amp; Lyle PLC issues the following update for the year ended 31 March 2015 ahead of the announcement of full year results on 28 May 2015. <br />
<br />
Based on trading performance for the fourth quarter there is no change from the guidance in our trading statement on 6 February 2015. We continue to expect Group adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2015 to be modestly below the range stated in September 2014 of &pound;230 to &pound;245 million<sup>1</sup>. <br />
<br />
As expected__*__ for the full year__*__ Group adjusted operating profit has been held back by the impact of the operational and supply chain issues experienced mainly in the first half__*__ and the continued extremely competitive market for SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose. <br />
<br />
We expect net debt at 31 March 2015 to be around &pound;500 million__*__ higher than reported at 31 December 2014 (&pound;466 million)__*__ principally due to investment in working capital as we continue to rebuild inventories and an exchange translation impact of around &pound;20 million following further strengthening of the US dollar. <br />
<br />
As planned__*__ the project to evaluate how best to maximise returns from SPLENDA<sup>&reg; </sup>Sucralose is reaching conclusion and will be finalised with the Board during April. We expect to communicate the outcome in the next few weeks. <br />
<br />
On 24 February 2015 we launched DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>TM </sup>Allulose__*__ a low-calorie sugar__*__ the most significant example of the innovation capability we established three years ago at our Commercial and Food Innovation Centre in Chicago. Since the launch__*__ we have seen encouraging early interest and engagement from customers across a range of applications__*__ and this supports our confidence in its longer term potential. However__*__ given the relatively long development and adoption cycles for new ingredients__*__ we do not expect it to have any material effect on the Group&rsquo;s performance during the next financial year. <br />

</ul>
<p><strong>Javed Ahmed__*__ Chief Executive__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;By re-aligning the Eaststarch joint venture we will focus in Europe on Speciality Food Ingredients__*__ and our Bulk Ingredients will become a predominantly North American business with strong market positions and efficient__*__ scale assets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are re-structuring SPLENDA<sup>&reg; </sup>Sucralose as a more sustainable business. Our broader Speciality Food Ingredients business has an expanding global footprint and a steady flow of new products targeted at the higher growth health and wellness space__*__ and is well-positioned for future growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overall__*__ the actions announced today streamline and further focus Tate &amp; Lyle as it continues to transition to a global Speciality Food Ingredients business supported by cash generation from Bulk Ingredients.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><br />
RE-ALIGNMENT OF EASTSTARCH EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE</strong></p>
<p>Tate &amp; Lyle and Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) have signed an agreement to re-align Eaststarch C.V. (Eaststarch)__*__ their joint venture corn wet milling business in Europe in which each owns a 50% equity share.&nbsp; Eaststarch was formed in 1992 and owns and operates three corn wet mills located in Slovakia__*__ Bulgaria and Turkey__*__ and has a 50% equity share in Europe&rsquo;s largest corn wet mill in Hungary.&nbsp; Eaststarch produces a range of products__*__ predominantly bulk ingredients__*__ which are sold to a number of multinational and regional food and industrial customers.&nbsp; Under the terms of the agreement__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle will:</p>
<p>‒&nbsp;Strengthen its Speciality Food Ingredients business by acquiring full ownership of the more speciality-focused plant in Slovakia<br />
‒&nbsp;Substantially reduce its European Bulk Ingredients footprint by exiting the predominantly Bulk Ingredients plants in Bulgaria__*__ Turkey and Hungary<br />
‒&nbsp;Receive a cash sum of &euro;240 million at closing__*__ subject to customary closing adjustments__*__ including for net cash and working capital__*__ and an additional payment of up to &euro;20 million in 2019 conditional on future corn and sugar pricing<br />
‒&nbsp;Continue to supply its European customers with crystalline fructose__*__ a speciality sweetener__*__ by being appointed as distributor for crystalline fructose produced from the plant in Turkey under a long-term agreement<br />
‒&nbsp;Focus its European business on Speciality Food Ingredients by appointing ADM as exclusive agent for Bulk Ingredients produced from the plant in Slovakia and Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s wholly-owned corn wet mill in The Netherlands under a long-term agreement. </p>
<p>Completion is conditional upon regulatory clearances which are expected in the summer.&nbsp; Net cash proceeds from this agreement to be received by Tate &amp; Lyle will be retained to provide flexibility to invest for growth in Speciality Food Ingredients.</p>
<p>In the year ended 31 March 2014__*__ Eaststarch had adjusted operating profit of &pound;107 million and gross assets of &pound;518 million of which the Group has a 50% share.&nbsp; Due to lower EU sugar prices__*__ the results of Eaststarch for the year ended 31 March 2015 are expected to be around 23% lower at about &pound;83 million.</p>
<p>Had the transaction taken effect from 1 April 2014__*__ Group adjusted operating profit in the year ended 31 March 2015 would have been reduced by &pound;32 million and diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by around 5.5 pence.&nbsp; Depending on the timing of completion of the transaction and the final transition arrangements__*__ we anticipate the reduction on Group earnings will be somewhat lower in the year ending 31 March 2016.&nbsp; We anticipate that__*__ following the impact of re-structuring the European operations__*__ from the start of the year ending 31 March 2017 the dilution in earnings as a result of the transaction will be around 3 pence per share.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As part of the Group&rsquo;s full-year results communication on 28 May 2015__*__ we will provide pro-forma financial information illustrating the impact of the transaction on our reported Group financial results for the year ended 31 March 2015.</p>
<p>The reform of the EU Sugar Regime in October 2017 brings with it the potential need for capital investment in bulk sweeteners.&nbsp; Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s strategy since 2010 has been to invest for growth in Speciality Food Ingredients and__*__ therefore__*__ the re-alignment of the joint venture at this time enables Tate &amp; Lyle to realise good value from its Bulk Ingredients&rsquo; assets before a decision on capital investment is required.</p>
<p>Further information on the financial impact is set out in the &lsquo;Exceptional Items&rsquo; section below.</p>
<p><strong><br />
RE-FOCUSING AND RE-STRUCTURING SPLENDA<sup>&reg; </sup>SUCRALOSE TO MAXIMISE RETURNS</strong></p>
<p>In the past 18 months__*__ industry economics for sucralose have changed significantly and__*__ against this backdrop__*__ we have undertaken a detailed analysis of our SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose business to evaluate how to maximise returns.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Demand for sucralose remains strong driven largely by consumer desire for more calorie-reduced food and drink__*__ and by the superior taste and functionality that sucralose delivers.&nbsp; However__*__ a substantial increase in capacity in the market__*__ particularly over the past two years__*__ which is now well in excess of demand__*__ has driven a significant change in industry behaviour and economics__*__ and we do not expect this to change materially in the medium term.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To maximise returns in a competitive market__*__ we have decided to re-focus the SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose business in two ways.&nbsp; Firstly__*__ we will take a rigorous valued-based approach to securing volume by focusing on the areas where we see value with customers who fully value the benefits of our SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose product including quality__*__ provenance__*__ food safety and responsible manufacturing and environmental practices.&nbsp; Secondly__*__ we will materially lower the manufacturing cost base of the business by consolidating all production into our facility in the US__*__ and closing the Singapore facility which will not be cost competitive going forward.&nbsp; These actions will position SPLENDA<sup>&reg; </sup>Sucralose as a more focused__*__ low-cost and sustainable business.</p>
<p>From Spring 2016__*__ all production of SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose will be consolidated into our facility in McIntosh__*__ Alabama__*__ US.&nbsp; Over the next 12 months there will be a phased transfer of production from Singapore to McIntosh__*__ after which the Singapore facility will be closed permanently.&nbsp; The McIntosh facility operating at a higher scale and utilisation level than it does currently will provide a materially lower-cost manufacturing position from which to operate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We expect to invest around &pound;18 million to consolidate production in McIntosh.&nbsp; This mainly relates to the transfer of equipment from Singapore to McIntosh__*__ and for additional equipment at McIntosh to produce all our SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose product forms.&nbsp; When the transfer is complete in Spring 2016__*__ McIntosh will be capable of supplying our customers&rsquo; existing and ongoing needs.&nbsp; McIntosh and Singapore both use the same process and manufacture to the same specification and__*__ therefore__*__ our product quality and service to customers will not be impacted.</p>
<p>The Singapore facility has played an important role in establishing the prominent position of SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose in the global high intensity sweetener market.&nbsp; However__*__ the combined effect of lower market pricing and higher energy and other production costs at the location__*__ has led us to conclude that the Singapore facility will not be cost competitive going forward.&nbsp; Singapore remains the location for our Regional Head Office and Applications Centre for Asia Pacific__*__ and a key hub for the future development of our Speciality Food Ingredients business in the region. </p>
<p>In the year ended 31 March 2014__*__ adjusted operating profit for SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose was <br />
&pound;62 million.&nbsp; As a result of the significantly changed industry economics over the past 18 months__*__ profits are expected to fall by 75% to around &pound;16 million in the year ended 31 March 2015.&nbsp; We continue to anticipate further price erosion in the year ending 31 March 2016.&nbsp; As a result__*__ we expect this business will be around breakeven in the year ending 31 March 2016 with some anticipated transition costs offsetting a lower depreciation charge.&nbsp; Looking further ahead__*__ in our 2017 financial year__*__ we expect this business to return to modest profitability. </p>
<p>We intend to disclose the headline financial performance of SPLENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> Sucralose in our results announcement for the year ended 31 March 2015 on 28 May 2015__*__ and to continue with this disclosure thereafter.</p>

</span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">(CHICAGO__*__ USA) &ndash; 9 July 2015 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a leading global provider of food ingredients and solutions__*__ serves a healthier twist on culinary classics at the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) Annual Meeting and Food Expo in Chicago__*__ July 11&ndash;14 (booth #1248). Developed to celebrate the IFT&rsquo;s 75th anniversary__*__ the tasting menu consists of reduced-calorie root beer craft soda; low-sodium__*__ crispy French fry sticks; gluten-free German chocolate bundtini cake; and a reduced-calorie/reduced-sugar__*__ soft-serve ice cream sundae bar.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">&ldquo;IFT&rsquo;s anniversary inspired us to create a classic-meets-trending menu that showcases our passion for food__*__&rdquo; said Luis Fernandez__*__ senior vice president of global applications at Tate &amp; Lyle. &ldquo;Attendees will experience &lsquo;better for you&rsquo; versions of culinary classics made extraordinary by our chefs and application scientists.&rdquo;</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">These culinary creations feature innovative ingredients from Tate &amp; Lyle including the recently introduced <a href=""http://www.dolciaprima.com/"">DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> Allulose</a>__*__ the low-calorie sugar that provides the satisfying mouthfeel and sweetness of sucrose; <a href=""http://www.tastevasweetener.com/Pages/Tasteva.aspx"">TASTEVA<sup>&reg;</sup> Stevia Sweetener</a>__*__ the zero-calorie sweetener that offers a clean taste with no bitter aftertaste; and a robust portfolio of fiber ingredients__*__ including <a href=""http://www.tateandlylefibres.com/"">PROMITOR<sup>&reg;</sup> Soluble Fiber</a> and <a href=""http://www.tateandlylefibres.com/"">PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup> Beta Glucan</a>.&nbsp;</span><br />

<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>New DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> Allulose Reduces Calories in Root Beer Craft Soda and Soft-Serve Ice Cream&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">As the first to market an allulose ingredient in the United States__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle plans to serve its DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> Allulose in a reduced-calorie root beer craft soda and reduced-calorie/reduced-sugar__*__ soft-serve ice cream bar at IFT15. These two classic treats have fewer calories without sacrificing the taste or mouthfeel consumers have come to expect. Made possible through Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s proprietary process to produce allulose on a commercial scale__*__ manufacturers can now offer consumers the best of both worlds: all the taste and texture of sugar but with 90% fewer calories.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />
</span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">To reduce calories by 50%__*__ the root beer craft soda uses Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s toolbox of sweeteners__*__ including DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> and TASTEVA<sup>&reg;</sup> Stevia Sweetener. The sugar and sweetener together create a unique synergy to enhance the sweetness of the beverage with a clean__*__ sweet taste with no bitter aftertaste.</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />
</span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">In addition__*__ attendees can taste DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> in a reduced-calorie/reduced-sugar__*__ soft-serve ice cream bar with a variety of toppings__*__ DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> behaves like sugar in a wide range of applications__*__ including ice cream. In fact__*__ it depresses the freezing point and helps provide the full texture of sugar__*__ offering the satisfying mouthfeel consumers are used to in full-calorie/full-sugar ice cream.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">&ldquo;The introduction of DOLCIA PRIMA<sup>&reg;</sup> to the North American market ensures manufacturers hit the sweet spot between great taste profile and calorie reduction__*__&rdquo; said Abigail Storms__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle vice president__*__ platform management__*__ sweeteners. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited to have people experience the taste firsthand at the show.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />
</span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>Fibers Address Many Manufacturer Challenges</strong></span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Consumers are increasingly looking for ways to fit fiber into their busy lifestyles &ndash; whenever and wherever they can. With broad expertise in fiber research__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle has a fiber portfolio to help manufacturers achieve a range of nutritional goals__*__ labeling options and health-benefit claims across a variety of food and beverage categories. Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s fiber portfolio includes PROMITOR<sup>&reg;</sup> Soluble Corn Fiber__*__ PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup> Beta Glucan and STA-LITE<sup>&reg;</sup> Polydextrose.</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />
</span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">PROMITOR&reg; unlocks superior digestive tolerance in high-fiber and sugar-reduced products while maintaining sensory expectations and ease of use. Expo attendees can experience how PROMITOR<sup>&reg;</sup> imparts additional mouthfeel and helps reduce calories and sugar in the root beer craft soda. It provides bulk__*__ texture and maintains great taste in the gluten-free German chocolate bundtini cake. In the reduced-calorie__*__ soft-serve ice cream__*__ PROMITOR<sup>&reg; </sup>helps with sugar reduction and texture.</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Finally__*__ attendees are sure to enjoy the crispy French fry sticks made with both PROMITOR<sup>&reg;</sup> and PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup>. The use of both fibers in the crispy French fry sticks offers an excellent source of fiber (5 grams per serving). PromOat<sup>&reg;</sup> Beta Glucan unlocks a natural fiber from oats with superior solubility and clean taste.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />
</span><strong><br />
</strong><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><strong>Clean-Label Starches Offer Label-Friendly Formulations</strong></span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Launched in October 2014__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s line of CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches enables manufacturers to reach a whole new audience of clean-label consumers__*__ without compromising product quality. The CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line offers manufacturers similar functionality to modified food starch plus the added benefits of a clean taste and clean label.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Attendees can experience the functionality of CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> in crispy French fry sticks with white cheddar dipping sauce__*__ and a gluten-free German chocolate bundtini cake. The white cheddar dipping sauce demonstrates high-performance thickening__*__ and a clean taste and color.</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />
</span><br />
<span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;"">Additionally__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle Food Systems developed a gluten-free base__*__ used in the gluten-free German chocolate bundtini cake__*__ which delivers on taste and offers a great moist texture that consumers look for in gluten-free products. CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> works perfectly in the icing__*__ due to a high thickening efficiency__*__ texture consistency__*__ clean taste and color that provide an exeptional overall mouthfeel and textural experience.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;""><br />

1196,Lucy Huang,Tate & Lyle,7/16/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Innovative Sodium Reduction Ingredient Provides Meaningful Reductions in Sodium Intake for the U.S. Consumer,"<strong>16 July__*__ 2015__*__ Hoffman Estates__*__ IL</strong> &ndash; Sodium intake in the U.S. exceeds dietary recommendations and has been identified as a nutrient of public health concern in the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee<sup>1 </sup>due to its link to increased risk of hypertension__*__ heart disease__*__ and stroke<sup>2</sup>. While authorities continue to call for people to lower their sodium intake__*__ much progress still needs to be made and multiple solutions are necessary to meet the recommended maximum intake of 2__*__300 milligrams per day for the general population and 1__*__500 milligrams per day for at-risk groups<sup>3</sup>. Two recent dietary modeling studies assessed the potential impact of a sodium reduction ingredient on sodium intake for both the general population as well as ethnic population subgroups__*__ and extrapolated future healthcare cost savings associated with reduced blood pressure that could be achieved with reductions in sodium intake.
<br />
<br />
New research__*__ published this month in <em>Food Science &amp; Nutrition</em>__*__ provides the most recent estimates of sodium intake among the U.S. population and assesses the potential impact of a sodium reduction technology on sodium intake via a modeling analysis<sup>4</sup>. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 data that included over 17__*__000 participants__*__ the study found that sodium reduction using Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres could potentially decrease sodium intake by 230-300 milligrams per day or about 7-9% of total sodium intake among the U.S. population depending on age and gender group. SODA-LO<sup>&reg; </sup>Salt Microspheres is a salt-reduction ingredient that can reduce sodium in certain foods through its technology__*__ which turns standard salt crystals into hollow salt microspheres that efficiently deliver salt taste and functionality by maximizing surface area.
<br />
<br />
Changing consumer behavior is difficult__*__ and some attempts to encourage individuals to lower dietary salt intake have largely proven to be ineffective<sup>5</sup>.  Thus__*__ using technology like SODA-LO<sup>&reg; </sup>Salt Microspheres could be instrumental in improving dietary intake and health among the U.S. population. The potential decrease of sodium intake by 300 milligrams per day in adults age 19-50 years is predicted to reduce systolic blood pressure by 0.45 to 0.88 mm Hg and potentially yield US$3.0 to US$5.3 billion in healthcare cost savings annually<sup>4</sup>.
<br />
<br />
A second study published in <em>Nutrition Journal </em>also used NHANES 2007-2010 data to model the potential impact of SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres on sodium intake in ethnic population subgroups who have higher risk for hypertension and associated diseases<sup>6</sup>. Based upon potential usage of
SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres__*__ there was a reduction of 185-323 milligrams sodium per day__*__ which translates to a 6.3-8.4% reduction of current sodium intake in ethnic population subgroups__*__ representing a meaningful reduction in these subgroups whose current intake exceeds recommendations.
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Together__*__ these two studies demonstrate how ingredient technologies like SODA-LO<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Microspheres can provide immediate solutions to reducing sodium intake while meeting consumer taste preferences__*__ and ultimately improving public health__*__&rdquo; said Michael Harrison__*__ PhD__*__ Senior Vice President__*__ New Product Development__*__ Innovation and Commercial Development at Tate &amp; Lyle. &ldquo;Tate &amp; Lyle is committed to providing food manufacturers with effective solutions that can help consumers lower their sodium intake and meet their current health and wellness needs.&rdquo;

<br />
<br />
The Group&rsquo;s trading performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and guidance for the full year remains unchanged.
<br />
<br />
Speciality Food Ingredients made an encouraging start to the year and performed ahead of the comparative period.  SPLENDA<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">&reg;</span></sup> Sucralose performed solidly as we continued to pursue volume only where we see value.  The consolidation of sucralose manufacturing into our facility in Alabama__*__ USA__*__ is progressing as planned supported by good customer engagement.  Volume growth for Food Systems was ahead of the comparative period benefitting from the acquisition__*__ last year__*__ of Gemacom in Brazil.  Volume across the balance of the Speciality Food Ingredients business was slightly behind the comparative period__*__ with volume improving as we exited the quarter.  We continued to take steps to address the impacts of the supply chain disruption experienced last year and we expect volume growth to strengthen through the remainder of the year as the additional capacity comes on-line in the second half.  The volume of new products grew strongly in the quarter.
<br />
<br />
Bulk Ingredients__*__ excluding commodities (ethanol and co-products)__*__ performed steadily and slightly ahead of the comparative period supported by solid sweetener demand.  However__*__ this was more than offset by the impact of commodities__*__ including the continuation of low US ethanol margins.
<br />
<br />
The process of obtaining regulatory approval for the re-alignment of the Eaststarch joint venture in Europe is progressing well and we expect to complete this transaction around the end of the second quarter of the financial year.
<br />
<br />
<strong>SALE OF EU SUGARS; UPDATE ON LITIGATION
</strong><br />
As previously announced and disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report__*__ American Sugar Holdings (ASR) raised a number of claims totalling in the region of &pound;40 million relating to its acquisition of the Group&rsquo;s EU Sugars business in September 2010. A trial of these proceedings was held in the Commercial Court in London in early May 2015__*__ with the judge&rsquo;s verdict expected later in the year.
<br />
<br />
<strong>FINANCIAL POSITION AND BALANCE SHEET
</strong><br />
Net debt was slightly lower than the position at 31 March 2015 aided by the translation effects of a stronger sterling.
<br />
<br />
Following the quarter end__*__ on 21 July 2015__*__ we priced a US$400 million debt private placement with notes to be issued maturing in 8__*__ 10 and 12 years__*__ extending the average maturity of our debt by approximately 2 years.  The transaction is expected to complete on 29 October 2015.
<br />
<br />
<strong>OUTLOOK
</strong><br />
Overall__*__ before the impact of exchange rate movements<sup><span style=""font-size:13px;"">1</span></sup> and the final timing of the completion of the Eaststarch transaction__*__ expectations for the Group&rsquo;s full year performance remain unchanged from our guidance in May.

1201,Lucy Huang,Tate & Lyle,8/18/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle Ventures backs Evolve BioSystems Inc.,"London__*__ August 18 2015 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures announces a $2 million investment in Evolve BioSystems__*__ Inc. a microbiome spin-out company from the University of California at Davis. Evolve is developing revolutionary science in the field of probiotics and prebiotics for new born infants during the crucial early months of development. The investment is part of a $9 million financing round led by Horizons Ventures and follows a seed investment by Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures in August 2014.<br />
<br />
This investment is part of the Tate &amp; Lyle Venture Fund which was established in 2013 to invest up to &pound;30 million over an eight-year period in start-ups and expansion-stage companies in food sciences and enabling technologies in line with Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s strategy to grow in speciality food ingredients.<br />
<br />
Evolve was established by researchers from the University of California at Davis based on a decade of research into the developing infant microbiome and its relationship with the natural nutrients in human breast milk. Evolve has a proprietary combination of activated probiotic bacteria__*__ prebiotics and delivery systems to provide__*__ restore and maintain a healthy microbiome in infants during the first 6 months of life - with particular focus on those born prematurely__*__ delivered by Caesarian section or fed exclusively with formula milk.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Completion of the Series A round ahead of schedule is a reflection of both the importance of the ground-breaking discoveries of the Company&rsquo;s founders at the University of California at Davis__*__ and a compelling business case that focuses on the improvement of the health trajectory for babies worldwide&rdquo; said Dr. David Kyle__*__ CEO of Evolve and former founder of Martek Biosciences. &ldquo;Evolve&rsquo;s deep understanding of the innate balance and dietary control of a healthy infant microbiome has demonstrated the need for new pro- and prebiotic products to return these precious systems to their natural state.

1210,Lucy Huang,Tate & Lyle,9/15/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle Ventures delivers latest exit from Fund I,"London__*__ 15 September 2015 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures announced today that its Fund I portfolio company Lumora Ltd has been sold to ERBA Diagnostics Mannheim GmbH (ERBA)__*__ a global in vitro diagnostics company. The sale was an all-cash transaction and follows the recent sale by Lumora of its proprietary sample preparation technology to Roche which it announced on 24 August 2015. <br />
<br />
This investment was part of Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures Fund I which was established in 2006. Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures first invested in Lumora__*__ a University of Cambridge spin out__*__ at the end of 2006 when the team led by CEO and founder Dr Laurence Tisi was still developing its molecular diagnostics technology within university labs. The Fund continued to support the business in a second round of investment in 2011 and was joined by Catapult Growth Fund to advance Lumora&rsquo;s technology to the commercial stage. <br />
<br />
Simon Barnes of Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures said &ldquo;We identified early on the potential of Lumora&rsquo;s molecular diagnostics platform and believed it could transform both food safety and clinical testing. At the time__*__ the Company had received a seed investment from the University of Cambridge and a group of business angels so we decided to invest in Lumora to support its growth potential.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
David Atkinson added &ldquo;The Lumora team has consistently delivered technological breakthroughs over the years and this has ultimately led to an excellent investment return for Fund I. We have worked with management to help build an outstanding company and we are delighted that ERBA will now take the business to its next stage of development.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Following the success of Fund I__*__ a new Tate &amp; Lyle Ventures Fund II was established in 2013. This Fund II is currently investing up to &pound;30 million over an eight-year period in start-ups and expansion-stage companies in food sciences and enabling technologies in line with Tate &amp; Lyle PLC&rsquo;s strategy to grow in specialty food ingredients. <br />

1218,Lucy Huang,Tate & Lyle,10/8/2015,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle PLC - Trading Update for six months ended 30 September 2015,"Tate &amp; Lyle issues the following trading update for the six months ended 30 September 2015 ahead of the announcement of Half Year Results on Thursday 5 November 2015.
<br />
<br />
<strong>OPERATING PERFORMANCE &ndash; CONTINUING OPERATIONS
</strong><br />
<br />
The Group&rsquo;s trading performance in the first half was in line with our expectations and guidance for the full year remains unchanged.
<br />
<br />
Speciality Food Ingredients performed encouragingly and ahead of the comparative period.  As anticipated__*__ the Speciality Food Ingredients business returned to volume growth in the second quarter. Volumes were also ahead of the comparative period in SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose and__*__ following the Gemacom acquisition__*__ strongly ahead in Food Systems.
<br />
<br />
Bulk Ingredients__*__ excluding commodities (ethanol and co-products)__*__ continued to perform steadily and slightly ahead of the comparative period supported by solid sweetener demand.  Commodities__*__ which continued to be impacted by low US ethanol margins__*__ were significantly lower than the comparative period__*__ and__*__ as a result__*__ Bulk Ingredients overall performed below the comparative period.
<br />
<br />
The annual bulk sweetener pricing round is in progress.  As previously communicated__*__ toll contracts represent around 75% of our US corn sweetener volumes__*__ significantly reducing the volume of our business that is re-contracted in any single year.
<br />
<br />
<strong>EASTSTARCH RE-ALIGNMENT
</strong><br />
<br />
The process of obtaining regulatory approval for the re-alignment of the Eaststarch joint venture in Europe is now concluded and we expect to complete this transaction during the third quarter of the financial year.
<br />
<br />
The Group will report the results of the disposed elements of the Eaststarch joint venture within Discontinued Operations in the financial year ending 31 March 2016.  In light of this__*__ in its presentation of adjusted performance measures__*__ the Group will cease the use of proportionate consolidation of joint ventures and adopt equity accounting for joint ventures.
<br />
<br />
We will publish shortly on our website (www.tateandlyle.com) comparative financial information for the six month period to 30 September 2014 and for the year ended 31 March 2015 showing the impact of these changes.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>OUTLOOK
</strong><br />
<br />
Overall__*__ before the impact of exchange rate movements<sup>1 </sup> and the final timing of the completion of the Eaststarch transaction__*__ expectations for the Group&rsquo;s full year performance remain unchanged from our guidance issued at our Full Year results in May 2015.

1256,Karen Coke,Tate & Lyle,7/15/2016,Press releases,For immediate release,Tate & Lyle Extends Clean-Label Portfolio with CLARIA Delight Tapioca-Based Starches at IFT Food Expo,"<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;""><em>Tate &amp; Lyle line extension enables manufacturers around the world to formulate products with cleaner labels while maintaining excellent taste__*__ texture__*__ colour and performance.</em></span><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;""><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">(LONDON) &ndash; 15 July 2016 &ndash; Tate &amp; Lyle__*__ a leading global provider of food ingredients and solutions__*__ announces an extension to its&rsquo; line of CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Functional Clean-Label Starches with the addition of CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight. Available globally__*__ the tapioca-based starches will make their debut at the 2016 Institute of Food Technologists Food Expo on 16 July in Chicago__*__ Ill. at booth #1248.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">Attendees will experience CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight on a &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; sweet street taco in a honey chipotle sauce. This booth bite will demonstrate how CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight can help manufacturers formulate products with cleaner labels while maintaining the taste__*__ texture__*__ colour and performance that their consumers and R&amp;D teams expect.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class=""TLBold"" style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">&lsquo;As consumer preferences evolve__*__ our customers are increasingly searching for innovative ways to simplify their ingredient lists__*__&rsquo; said Judy Whaley__*__ Vice President of Texturants New Product Development at Tate &amp; Lyle. &lsquo;But__*__ sometimes__*__ cleaner labels can come with trade-offs in sensory attributes or functionality. We&rsquo;ve worked hard over the past several years to ensure our customers don&rsquo;t have to make those trade-offs &ndash; helping to make their products both healthier and tastier. CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight is a great example of that hard work in action.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;""><span class=""TLBold"" style=""font-family:Arial;""><strong>The &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; quest continues</strong>&nbsp;</span><em><span class=""TLBold""><br />
</span></em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">The number of products launched with &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; claims<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>continues to grow across the world. According to Innova (2015)__*__ 28% of new products launched in 2015 had one or more &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; claims compared to 26% in 2014 and 24% in 2013. Australasia and North America are leading the world with launches at 51% and 40% above the global average respectively.</span></p>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">Consumers are also willing to pay more for products that make &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; claims. For example__*__ in North America and Europe__*__ &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; soups__*__ sauces and yoghurt are most likely to carry a price premium (as much as 22%). Globally__*__ the largest price premium for &lsquo;clean labels&rsquo; is in the yoghurt category__*__ at 19% above the category average.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> D</span><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">elight helps manufacturers meet this consumer demand because it is suitable for use in products that make a variety of trending &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; claims including &lsquo;non-GM.&rsquo; The world&rsquo;s fastest-</span><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">growing &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; claim__*__ &lsquo;non-GM&rsquo; claims on new product launches have grown an average of 14% per year from 2010 to 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;""><span class=""TLBold"" style=""font-family:Arial;"">&lsquo;Depending on their target audience__*__ there is an enormous opportunity for our customers around the world to simplify ingredient lists and take advantage of the trending claims that come along with that__*__&rsquo; said </span>Werner Barbosa__*__ Global Platform Leader Texturants__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">&lsquo;Our job is to partner with our customers to help them meet these challenges__*__ and retain their competitive edge locally and globally. With the updated CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line__*__ it&rsquo;s easier than ever to make that a reality.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;""><strong>It&rsquo;s all about the taste (and texture)</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">In the starch category__*__ tapioca is particularly trending. In fact__*__ of the top five starches used in clean-label products from 2010 to 2015__*__ tapioca starches saw the fastest growth &ndash; a 27% average increase in new product launches (Innova__*__ 2015).<br />
<br />
</span><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight delivers the tapioca flavour__*__ colour and texture preferred with manufacturers and consumers in a variety of applications including some soups__*__ sauces__*__ yoghurts__*__ custards__*__ mousse and fruit preps. Its texture is similar to modified tapioca starches__*__ thickening and setting to form a soft__*__ translucent gel that is especially desirable to consumers in applications like yoghurt.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight also has a clean flavour that is beneficial in delicately-flavoured soups__*__ sauces__*__ and dairy desserts. In addition__*__ it has a clean__*__ white colour that is essential for developing light-coloured products. In fact__*__ CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight has been shown in internal sensory testing to have a lighter colour and cleaner taste than other functional &ldquo;clean-label&rdquo; tapioca-based starches on the market.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;""><strong>Innovative technology enables high performance</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">In addition to its excellent sensory attributes__*__ CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight enables manufacturers to develop products with functionality similar to modified tapioca starches. While native tapioca starches break apart under heat and shear__*__ Tate &amp; Lyle&rsquo;s proprietary processing technique enables CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight granules to stay intact after cooking under a range of conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">In addition__*__ the viscosity of CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight is versatile and can be tailored to a variety of applications__*__ with a range comparable to modified starches. In fact__*__ according to customer feedback__*__ CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight can be used as a one-for-one replacement for modified tapioca starches while other functional &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; tapioca starches must be used at higher concentrations to provide comparable thickening.</span></p>
<p><span class=""TLBold"" style=""font-size:14px;font-family:Arial;"">In addition to CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight__*__ the CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> line features three corn-based__*__ &lsquo;clean-label&rsquo; functional starches including CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Essential__*__ CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Plus and CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Elite. Launched globally in October 2014__*__ these starches leverage the same technology as CLARIA<sup>&reg;</sup> Delight &ndash; enabling functionality and sensory attributes similar to modified starches while allowing for simpler ingredient lists.</span></p>

This Trading Statement covers the period from 1 April 2016 to 30 June 2016__*__ which is the first quarter of the financial year.<br />

The Group made a strong start to the year with profit ahead of the comparative period in constant currency. The encouraging start to the year supports our confidence that we will continue to make progress__*__ at constant currency__*__ in the full year.<br />
<br />
Speciality Food Ingredients performed solidly with profit for the division overall ahead of the

comparative period reflecting good margin improvement. Volume was slightly lower than the&nbsp;comparative period with good growth in Europe__*__ Middle East and Africa__*__ which benefited from&nbsp;the acquisition of the Slovakia facility__*__ and stabilisation in Latin America__*__ more than offset by&nbsp;softer demand in North America__*__ Asia Pacific and Food Systems.<br />
<br />
Profit for SPLENDA&reg; Sucralose was significantly higher than the comparative period benefiting&nbsp;from strong volume growth from the sell-down of inventory carried into the financial year&nbsp;following the consolidation of the sucralose manufacturing footprint.<br />
<br />
Bulk Ingredients performed strongly with profit well ahead of the comparative period due to solid&nbsp;demand at the start of the US summer beverage season__*__ robust US bulk sweetener margins__*__&nbsp;and strong manufacturing performance. In Commodities__*__ performance was broadly in line.<br />
<br />
The Group generates less than 2% of its revenues in the United Kingdom__*__ with most revenues&nbsp;being US dollar based. Sterling has weakened significantly in recent weeks and__*__ if current&nbsp;exchange rates were to prevail for the remainder of the financial year__*__ our reported earnings&nbsp;would increase strongly<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;due to US dollar and other currency movements.<br />
